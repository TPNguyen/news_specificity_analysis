I still can't believe a 777 can just vanish and not be found in this world today. OMG , it just blows my mind. This whole mess smells. I don't know what , where or how all this happened , but I bet we will find out in the future , resulting in a big bang. I still think it's in Pakistan , or general area. But hell , everyone has a theory . But the Malaysia authorities are the biggest joke I have seen that's one thing the World is sure of.

neturei, I'm ashamed of you! Russia does too & had better reason to cause distraction while they invaded Ukrane. Are you Russian?

commenter----I don't think so. Where would if be coming from? Or does the world just let any old country start flying any old place with any old plane? I believe everything that size is registered and known by every country. Fake plane ? nawww.

muslim MALAYSIA is in COLLUSION with their FELLOW muslim nations..... IRAN Provides the NUCLEAR WEAPON MALYASIA provides the DELIVERY SYSTEM

What a piece of BS from someone who has lost the plot and tries to justify why those under his command do not react on it. If it was an actual intruder, we would be overrun by now with this kind of attitude. This is really unprecedented anywhere in the world.

I think maybe the personnel on duty were asleep at their desks. It was after midnight when all this happened. That's why there was such a delay. They had to finish their naps, and when they woke up, they realized the plane was no longer transmitting with its transponder! :-)

The plane didn't crash. There would be debris found, however minute. There is more going on than the public will know. All the searching and false sightings are just distractions. Hopefully, the passengers are alive and well but they are probably being held prisoner somewhere

The government of Malaysia has a long record of lying through its teeth every time it finds itself in a jam. The missing plane and the accompanying tissue of lies and trickery is only just one example. When some very high apartment blocks suddenly collapsed, it bribed the builder to claim that the collapse was due to an earthquake but that was just so much baloney. There was no earth tremor. The real reason was shoddy materials and workmanship. Malaysia is a tin pot, massively corrupt and third-going-on-fourth world nation and that isn't going to change any time soon.

I think part of what factors in, peripherally, is that Malays in particular do not like being answerable to white 'Sahibs" as they see them. Even when outrageously out of order, as in this case, they just will not accept having their homework corrected by whites, who they see as flashbacks to the colonial past , or possibly to any foreigners. That is the very reason why an abberrant individual like Mahathir, reponsible for the stupid comments about Boeing being to blame, was PM, and a popular one, for a long time. Mahathir disrespected the local Chinese, disrespected and insulted white countries especially Australia, and was always good for a nutbag Jewish conspiracy theory about 'Dem Jews always keepin' us muslims down". It's about political maturity. It's still a long way off in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines...

It is a SOP for all Air Forces around the world to check and verify the unidentified aircraft by sending fighter jets if it does not respond to transponder or to any voice call. Top bosses of Air Force or CAA or the Defence minister know the secret or they had been bribed or threatened to keep quite about this air piracy (hijacking). The aircraft must have had some secret cargo or secret personnel on board, which some organization or country did not want to reach its intended destination. Those who had been told to keep quite about this air piracy may not necessarily know the type of cargo the flight had on board. Anyway, those who made propaganda that flight MH370 had landed smoothly in open ocean at night and sank smoothly to the bottom of the ocean are to be checked out first for involvement in this conspiracy. An aircraft like Boeing-777 can not land in an open ocean (specially at night) without breaking-off and shooting thousands of 'never-to-sink' debris in the ocean surface. Is there any Boeing 777 pilot give a demonstration at day time that he can land smoothly on Indian ocean without breaking his aircraft in to pieces? And why the pilots or the intended terrorists would want to land the aircraft smoothly in the open ocean at night? Did they want to practice night landing at night in the open ocean? Then where are the passengers?

Thats because the plane is on a secret base in Australia

I keep getting confused. Was he the Baltimore Orioles shortstop in the late 70's, or is the the Spanish golfer?

HE WAS TOLD NOT OT FOLLOW IT TO OUR SECRET DIEGO GARCIA BASE.

Diego Garcia secret base? If it is such a secret, why do you know about it?

DIEGO GARCIA AIRPORT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED

Ask navy seals Reynolds and Kennedy that loaded cargo aboard MH370..oops sorry- they are dead. Ask the American engineer on board who's phone last reported a GPS reading near DG...oops, he's dead too. Ask Russian intelligence that tracked the flight to Diego Garcia..... Ask why one pilot's computer recovery on his home flight simulator showed he was practicing a landing at Diego Garcia...oops! He's dead too. Ask the person on board who methodically turned off all communications systems why it took him 18 minutes to do it? Oops! He's dead too.

It sounds crazy because it is... If this was the plan, why wouldn't they have done something by now. It's not easy to hide a 777 (or land, or service it) without people finding out. The longer they hold on to it, the greater the chance of the plan going awry.

Diego Garcia? I'm confused. Was he the Baltimore Orioles shortstop in the late 70's, or is he the Spanish golfer?

the yanks have it on diego garcia

Yep they did a great job they know nothing and have said nothing……

....you are just looking to blame..... and you do not even know all the truth or all the facts.

There has been no other creditable witness. If an oil rig worker say something, why can it be discounted. No one else has a clue.

I still don't buy it that the US Government knows nothing...

this h2o speaks rubbish...not fit to be a minister

Total failures by Malay's defense minister....

that is why they are dedicating all the resources to trying to find that airplane. Understanding what happened and why it happened is the first step to preventing it from happening again.
