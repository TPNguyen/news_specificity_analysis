Not strange at all. Boeing would have records of the *original* factory parts serial numbers. Then some of those parts could have been replaced at any time after the plane went into service. If the airlines who operated it did not keep proper records, there could be Boeing-made parts on there that are not original to the plane, and no evergreen record of what serial numbers are actually on that aircraft. Thus, there would be no way to confirm it 100% if it's not a factory-installed part, and nobody has an accurate record of replacement parts serial numbers. Fingers are being pointed at Malaysian Airlines for faulty record-keeping.

Actually KenZ, if the operators had to cannibalize such a part, there is supposed to be a paper trail, records change, etc. But in the long run, it would not be economical to do such, and cause two aircraft to have to be re-rigged and tested. Instead most operators would order an assembly, or remove, repair and reinstall it. Then it must go through a operational testing, and even a flight test if needed, before the aircraft could be put back into service. But that presumes that the operator is using Boeings maintenance procedures, and so on. Also depends upon the operator using certified Boeing parts. In the past, there was a spat of trouble with 747 flaps on some foreign operators aircraft, with failure happening. Turns out, the contracted maintenance company was using off-brand parts, not quite up to Boeing standards. A model one time inspection was ordered, with a suspense date, that had to be met, if the plane was to fly in America, or Europe airspace. Several bad parts were recovered, because of this inspection. Now what that means, is if there is no record of ever changing this part on that aircraft, then there is a very good chance the piece did indeed come from the missing airliner. And while in the ocean for almost a year, it probably made the numbers hard to read, and they had to turn to science to see them. And that takes some time. Many foreign operators use contracted maintenance services to maintain their aircraft, Singapore being one that comes quickly to mind. Even some of our military aircraft are serviced there.

If Boeing replaces any part, they keep records of it, and they investigate why the part failed. They keep records and serial numbers on where all their parts go. You seem to think aircraft manufacturers are like auto manufacturers, and they're not. If they have one with defects, they don't throw it in the ocean; they recycle it.

What does France have to do with anything? It's a Malaysian airline and a US made aircraft. Why not just send the part to Boeing for analysis?

The part should have been sent to Boeing for ID.

One plausible reason why France did not send the airplane part directly to Boeing may have been so that they did not look like they were incompetent in analyzing the part themselves. Imagine what would happen if Boeing returned the part saying that it was not from one of their planes - people would say the French were incompetent. Boeing is an American manufacturer and the flaperon was found on French soil. That's just a guess.

If they had sent the part to Boeing they would have had the answer with in 24 hours.

Why France? Boeing is in the U.S. Boeing made that part. What do they say? Something doesn't add up.

Actually, Boeing only confirmed that the part was from a 777

@Gandozer, actually it would be as to how many are missing without knowledge. And that number would be a very small number indeed. Because of the planes age, new, and the lack of hundreds of flight miles and years of service, the stock of such spare parts would be limited. And one missing, would stand out like a sore thumb. This is not like putting the spare on your car, but a flight control surface, and its replacement would require rigging, and hydraulic testing, to ensure its safe operation. Along with that, perhaps even a flight function test. So I will bet that the producer, Boeing, knows exact numbers of all parts of this type, and has the mountain of paper work required to produce it, from where the alum was mined, refined, stamped, and formed into the part. Even if from one of its suppliers, the paper trail is mandatory. Building planes, is not like building autos or houses. More precise, and controlled, with QA checks and rechecks along the way. Once it goes into service, Boeing continues to monitor and knows life-cycle information etc. And if a part like this were to fail, especially in flight, it would be reported back to them. So in the lack of such a happening, in the past year, or history of the model aircraft, I would suspect that it did come from MH-370, the question is now how it got to where it was found. Ocean currents okay, then it can be modeled back to certain areas and a new search plan formed. Look at how long it took to find the Air France plane that crashed in the Atlantic. Almost a year also . But find it they did.

What way to die._______Crack into the water & ??.

Destiny, the wing floated to Reunion, so I'm sure they are looking around Reunion for more floating debris since it would travelled along with the wing. But as far as the plane goes...IT"S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO REUNION.

That part was floating around for a year. No way to know how far it drifted.

How many flaperons are their floating around in the ocean?

er... parts floating in the water bob UP AND DOWN... and half of it is ALWAYS going to be under water. And not having seen which water tight sections were still 'water tight', it's likely that the wing didn't float "flat" but bobbed upright like a pencil.

The flaperon could have floated into shallow waters after the crash. In that amount of time, it could have traveled hundreds of mile, bobbing in the water, hence the barnacles...

?? Reunion is an island, it washed up on the beach.

Okay, so where is the rest of MH370??? Where are floating seat cushions, floating debris, floating luggage, floating cargo, bodies??? Something ain't right here.

How did the wing part get so far up on the beach from the water? Why was it just discovered? Was it planted?

If MH370 plummeted from 30,000 feet from the air and was decimated on impact and not one (NOT ONE) of over 300 floating airline seats or parts of floating life saving floating seats in water didn't surface to the top of the ocean and stayed intact on impact? There looking for a scapegoat. This wing found is a load of #$%$. Floating seat devices never have not floated to the top before. That really doesn't make me feel safe about using an airline seat as a floating device because they don't float. It's a joke. That plane is not in the ocean. I don't know where it is, but its not the ocean and that wing isn't from MH370 I don't care what they say.

What do Koala bears have to do with it?

77.7 IQ points missing from Tailgator

There is no other missing 777 in the world. The jibberish is yours

And in other news, sources at the ministry of nonsense and buffoonery have confirmed that Topsuite is a charter member

It wasn't confirmed until France confirmed it.

confirmed, the confirmation of the confirmation was confirmed...

I heard it on the news weeks ago it was confirmed...

@J P Hangedwell - I think the collective wit of the yahoo readership exceeds the collective wit of the yahoo writers.

They thought there might have been another 777 missing in our parallel universe!

I think termites chewed through the control cabls.
