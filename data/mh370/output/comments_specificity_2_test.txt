If no more of flight MH370 is found, use the piece as part of a memorial for those lost.

Wendy. COmmon sense should tell you unless you are blonde that Wreckage from an aircraft that large will not be limited to just this SINGLE piece. No other parts have been found NONE.. that makes this complete bull #$%$.

Georgie, that doesn't identify the part any more than saying a spark plug fits a certain engine. And maritime experts DID say where the part had been for the past 12+ months... it was floating around in the INDIAN OCEAN! And they wouldn't ask "experts in oceanography" they'd confer with marine biologists. And the flaperon was covered with goose and stalk barnacles, NOT mollusks... and, no, they're NOT the same thing. Like Bill said... you've been watching too much CSI and think you have a clue. RLS, were you with the 552nd? I was 552nd at McClellan.

It's not that they didn't think it was part of it, it's not that it took this long to figure it out, it's that they needed to be absolutely sure before telling anyone about it. If you find a possible piece of an airplane that had that many people on it, and no one knew where it went, you can't really be afford to be wrong if it turns out to not be an actual part.

What? It took this long? The manufacturer should have been able to identify this part in ONE DAY....what gives?

LOST! The part is a planted part OR this is just a fake story that the part was found. Has anyone ever seen LOST? The fact is that the plane was in S Korea. That is a 100% fact since, just days after the accident, there was a "for sale" ad for the aircraft in the SK Craigslist.

I'm no rocket scientist but when the claim was made that this piece of debris was part of a ladder I thought BULL SHIRT!!!

Did it really have to take this long to prove this was from the aircraft,as an aircraft engineer,I could have identified the part and given you an answer by return of post,the hold up smells of fish and I dont mean the "flaperon"!!!

I performed aircraft maintenance repairs for twenty years at Tinker Air Force Base, and I can assure you there is no way to identify a specific airplane part based on the appearance of its rivets or weldments. Amelia Earhart's plane disappeared nearly 80 years ago and has never been found. What makes you so confident that MH370 will be discovered? So...if I may ask...what exactly qualifies you as an expert in the field of airline disaster investigations? You come across like you should be in charge of the investigation, but somehow I rather doubt that. You make it sound like a different blueprint is drawn up for every plane that gets built, which makes each plane unique. This is not how the job gets done. If every plane had its own unique blueprint, the cost of building each plane would become enormous. BTW: The word you were searching for is 'traceability'. As far as your mollusk comment goes, the flaperon was reported to have been caught in a gyre in the Indian Ocen, and so around and around it went, much like a towel in a washing machine. Without knowing precisely where the flaperon entered this gyre, it is impossible to work backwards in an effort to determine where it went down.

well duuuuh....I could of told them that when they found it....let's see "It's definitely FROM a 370....there's only ONE 370 missing"....what took so long??? what a bunch of idiots

I wonder since it came from the ocean, if France and Spain will get in an argument about which country it belongs to. Both jump at the chance to claim treasure that other folks find, because those countries are too lazy to treasure hunt themselves. Scrap aluminum and or titanium generally bring good prices per pound, by U.S. firms dealing in scrap metal. You can bet one of the two has dibs on it.

Li & Eddie - It was aliens that took the plane and then replicated a wing part for us to find. Give us a break, it was from MH370.

One day they will find it.

Courtney Love could have come to this conclusion the day it was found.

What they found is probably the biggest piece left of MH370. This mystery will never be solved...

According to the article the officials chose to ignore it since it didn't fall into their predetermined search area.

All of this information can be found on Hillary Clinton's server.

Aliens can beam up your tin-foil hat too.
