I hope they are sure this is really from the only missing 777 in world history. These flaperons fall of constantly there must thousands floating in just the Indian Ocean alone.

Putin has the plane in a hangar. His KGB cronies planted the flaperon on Reunion Island. NOW everyone will think it's in the Indian Ocean.

Gandozer.. I REALLY hope you are not serious.. cause if you're that goofy to think that Boeing aircraft parts are just are just "floating around" in the ocean.. then you need help with other aspects in life.

@Anthony, you think someone ordered a replacement wing section and washed it up on a shore a year and a half later in a part of the ocean where no one was even looking to dispel a hijacking conspiracy? Take your meds bro, I promise their to help you.

What other plane, if not mh370's, would the 777 flaperon belong too? Its not like multiple of these have crashed into the ocean.

Prior to this "official" announcement, I was wondering how many Boeing 777 flaperons were missing world-wide. Especially, in the area surrounding the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370. We now have the answer. Big mystery solved.

Not necessarily,the flaperon is just such a piece that can come off in a soft water landing or be dislodged from the plane body by ocean currents at the bottom of the sea,in either case it is an astounding and miraculous find.

Are people really this stupid? Is there anyone who thinks that this part may have fallen off another 777 flying overhead & nobody noticed it missing from the aircraft?

Where else would it be from? How many spare wings are floating around from missing planes?

So this piece of wing just fell off the plane and then it crashed into a deep part of the Indian ocean.

I'm glad French aviation experts took the time to test the paint and the metal and did not reach a hasty conclusion that the flaperon was from MH370 unlike Malaysia. Conceivably some evil genius could have planted this part on Reunion island just for the thrill of throwing a monkey wrench into the investigation.

Then at the end of July, a man on Reunion island -- a French overseas territory -- found the two-metre-long (almost seven-foot) wing part, which was flown to France for tests by aviation experts.

"It is possible today to say with certainty that the flaperon discovered on Reunion island on July 29 came from flight MH370," Wow what a statement....

Putin has the plane in a hangar. His KGB cronies planted the flaperon on Reunion Island. NOW everyone will think it's in the Indian Ocean.

Brilliant. it only takes the French a month to figure out what everyone else knew on day 1 part was found. ITS A 777 FLAPERON. ONLY POSSIBILITY MH-370

This plane landed on Diego Garcia. Finding a flaperon on La Reunion Island would rather confirm than contradict this theory.

Oh, it had the same serial number and it took the French investigators 1 1/2 months to say the part is from the downed plane.

Wow. Took them over a month to find numbers on the wing part. Some crack investigators the French have.

The flaperon washed ashore on Reunion Island. That's French territory. It would have made more sense to me to send the part to Boeing in Seattle, but a French airline mechanic can find a serial number just as well as any other and read it off to Boeing.

Boeing didn't throw any flaperons with the same serial number into ocean so how did the French determine that the part was from that plane when the whole world new it a month ago?
