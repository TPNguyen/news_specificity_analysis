the possibilities of a any number of situations in relations to the plane structure and concerning issue s relating to that type of plane in question,as to reflecting on anything -being possible to resulting in a mid air incident ...has been questioned at the time of this plane disappearance......that we may never know....but i do support what u say where by if any ....we can try and bring some kind of normality to love one s of those missing

Looks like American military equipment shows up shot in real action. Time to call in the manned Sea Dragon from China, which can go 7000m, almost twice as deep as the US robot. Sea Dragon can go where no man or robot have gone before. Now copy that!

my only answer to you is:........if to what ever situation arise s in front of us......we will try .....we will find a way to challenge those decisions when that time comes....Hey ..if we can walk on the moon......we can walk on the ocean floor

Never the less:..all said to be ..and what info stands creditable ..i think i would myself ...like to also,as i have from the begin-following forth with actual personal siting s of a plane at the time of MH370 disappearance not being a coinsidence but actual witnessed siting s what was seen and possibly related to MH370 last been visually seen

And what robotic company do you work for. Assuming you do work for one with all your commet's about knowing how far down they can go. I think you should back to your other job of pole dancing

You're a moron and should be ashamed for insulting the memory and suffering of all those families who lost loved ones. Right, all those countries are just spending millions and millions for a search and rescue operation that does not exist. The only credible part of questioning what took place is that the plane indeed isn't where they all say it is and flew in a different direction and landed probably due to some unknown cargo that was of interest to certain third parties.

No they're not gonna find anything? Why? Because media is still hot on their every move.....they will "plant" the black box later when news choppers and ships are not following them. Because the plane is never under the water

It's common sense to anyone following the story. Unless of course you have been living under a rock.

this just in, media hyped up this mission that bluefin told them it would take 2 months + and everyone wants results in a day! this article is almost as bad as cnn! get real media. report on facts, now you just sound pathetic.

China woukd like more of their citizens to go missing, they have too many!

It is a direct consequence of the Malaysian government's gross incompetence and criminal negligence that has led to the almost hopeless situation of having approximately 24 hours of black box battery life remaining and thousands upon thousands of square miles of ocean floor left to search . On the morning of March 8 , around the time ( 01:30 ) that MH370 switched off it's transponders on purpose and disappeared from the DCA radars , an unidentified aircraft was spotted on the marconi military radars of the royal malaysian air force flying due east across the entire breadth of Malaysia but no attempt to communicate with this unidentified aircraft was ever made by the RMAF , presumably no staff spotted it and it was later revealed by the Malaysian authorities nearly a couple of weeks later on a check back of the radar recordings and after it was independently confirmed by Inmarsat that MH370 did in fact turn back from it's north east direction towards Beijing to south west towards the Southern Indian Ocean . But for some inexplicable reason the Malaysian authorities decided to withold this crucial piece of radar data from the international community with the consequence that the international search and rescue teams wasted a better part of 2 weeks searching the South China Sea instead of the Southern Indian Ocean . It is a revelation indeed that the standard operating procedures of the Royal Malaysian Air Force includes allowing unidentified aircrafts to fly above it's airspace at free will and unchallenged and that certain airports ( Kota Bharu airport which MH370 flew over on it's turn back ) will switch of their radar system at midnight and the DCA staff go home for the night hence the " Goodnight MH370 " transcript .

Amazingly not ONE piece of floating debris has been found of this massive airliner.. Possibly the fuselage did not break up and is still completely intact, no wing or tail assembly sections broke free, no inner wing urethane strength foaming or countless other buoyant articles that readily float, like on the Atlantic Air France jet that crashed and a debris field slowly floated to the surface. Only 4 black box ghost pings were detected, then all went silent, that is amazing. OR, possibly because it is not in the ocean at all. No clues, No trace. This will rival the morbid & gruesome Titanic public fascination & mystery that has lasted for over a hundred years now.... God only knows how many Hollywood movies and History channel ghouls will be making a living for years to come off this tragedy. Meanwhile the families have to listen and watch all these circus presentations by so-called news media Bull Z)(it P T Barnum talking head shows like C N N suggesting black holes and space alien abductions what heartless even cruel Bull Z)(it. My heart goes out to these family members.

Actually, the course wasn't random. The aircraft departed from it's course at a very fortuitous moment - when it was being handed off from Malaysia ATC to Vietnam ATC. This is a time when, if someone wanted to create confusion with ATC and buy some time to get away, they would do it. It's too much of a coincidence that it happened at this moment; it wasn't an accident. After that, the aircraft made a controlled turn to the southwest and climbed to about 39,000 feet for 20 minutes. Pilots have an unlimited supply of oxygen while passengers only have 15 minutes. The aircraft then descended to about 4000 feet as it crossed Malaysia. After that, it ascended again but stayed low to avoid other air traffic, about 14,000 feet. After it cleared the southern tip of Thailand and was out in the Straits of Malacca, it turned north until it cleared the tip of Sumatra. Once it cleared Sumatra, it turned west, and once it cleared Sumatra, it turned south towards the open ocean. These are not random moves; someone had to be flying the plane since an aircraft fly itself like that. It's clear that someone was maneuvering the aircraft to avoid, firstly, Thai, airspace and then Indonesian airspace. Whoever was flying it did not want jets scrambled to investigate, which would have happened if the aircraft had violated the airspace of either Thailand or Indonesia. Apparently, Malaysia was asleep at the wheel. All of these maneuvers have been verified from the radar data of the Malaysian military and the military radar of surrounding countries, at least Thailand and possibly Indonesia.

It depends on how the aircraft crashes. 2 ELT's are activated by rapid deceleration, and 2 are activated by hard impact. If there was no rapid deceleration or hard impact, they would not have been activated until the plane sunk. After it sinks, the ELT's are useless because without an antenna floating on the surface, their signals will not reach the satellites.

The aircraft was deliberately flown to avoid detection and to misdirect search efforts of this there is no doubt. The purpose the aircraft was taken was accomplished within six to eight hours. We will never find the plane. This is where I venture off...the plane landed at a remote runway built specially for this one purpose. The aircraft either took off or another aircraft took the recorders and dumped them at sea. This whole thing is an elaborate deception. The plane or something on the plane was purposely stolen for reasons unknown...or not told to the public.

When you connect all the dots, whoever was at the controls of this aircraft was flying it with a purpose, from the moment it first left its intended route at least until it headed south over the open ocean west of Sumatra and maybe beyond that. An aircraft can't fly all on its own like without someone controlling it.

Wake up world there is no plane in that ocean . If there was something, anything would have floated up somewhere . A seat cushion, , a drink container, a baby's bottle ,an empty fuel tank. It's time the world was told the truth. Where is that plane Dan

The problem with looking for debris from the plane, ie seat cushions, luggage, personal items, wrappers etc etc is that they are to small to see. The ships are large and the planes fly at least a couple thousand feet off the oceans surface. These guys might have good eyes but nobody can spot a seat cushion several thousand feet away on a constantly moving surface. It is very much on the line of looking for a grain of rice on a football field with a magnifying glass. This is, btw, in the roaring 40's zone, subject to intense storms and surface conditions. Also consider the plane may not have impacted at any great angle but 'landed' and remained mostly intact and sunk shortly afterwards. Because of currents larger pieces could be hundreds of miles apart because of the depth. @Seven - The harley didn't wash up on shore here in BC. The container it was in did, containers can float, depending on whats in them and how they sit in the water...This one everything shifted towards the doors making that end heavy which left an air pocket at the other, sealed end, that kept it afloat.

They can't replace it in a couple of days. You can't run done to Sub-R-Us and buy another one so they need to be judicious about the risks they take or they can be left without the primary asset for surveying the bottom with the requisite resolution to find the 777 wreckage.

That "uninterruptible autopilot" was *patented* by Boeing in 2006 in a brainstorming exercise for how to deal with hijackings. It was never added to any production aircraft because of the risk of the exact scenario you are now outlining. Even if it were, it's just on an independent electrical bus, but it's not magical. Terrorists would not be able to override it (unless extremely well-briefed) but someone familiar with the mechanical parts of a plane could kill it with a pair of wire cutters. I agree with Maurice... "alternative media" = no pesky fact-checking and lots of lunatic theory-crafting.

Was that supposed to be funny?

And if your love one was on the plane

52000 square km should be 20000 square miles.

52,000 square kilometers = 32 square miles?

They'll never find the plane, it disappeared into another unknown dimension.

Never going to find it, please forward to all interested.

Hey... give it up and quit wasting money!

Wonderful, now when the hell are we (including the Australians) going to stop wasting money on this?

it's funny all the money being wasted on this nonsense... THEY ARE ALL DEAD!

Give up, already! The plane will never be found.
