Since the final satellite ping tells exactly when the jet ran out of fuel, and since they know the precise distance to the satellite for the time of each of the 7 pings, There is enough info to infer the airspeed and altitude for each possible route (fuel burn rate depends on both airspeed and altitude). The possible routes vary from passing near Australia (where they searched) to a southerly route much farther east including headed straight for Kerguelen Island. The satellite ping data best fits the more easterly southern route (that is what Inmarsat had on their web site). But officials believe the underwater sounds of the black box were detected much closer to Australia which is why they stopped looking elsewhere. However, the black box beacon sounds were the WRONG FREQUENCY and were spread across too large an area to be the black box. They need to return to where the satellite ping data led them originally which is towards Kerguelen Island. They should be able to confirm the path after calculating the airspeed and altitude that matches all the data. After knowing the altitude and airspeed and direction when the jet ran out of fuel, they should duplicate in the simulator where it would have splashed. They can confirm the validity and accuracy of the calculations by comparing it to the 7 other aircraft being pinged by the satellite and measure the difference between the ping calculations and the known position of those jets

The satellite data best matches a route west of the search zone. They are searching in the wrong area only because the sound signals. But the sound signals were the wrong frequency by about 10% and they were picked up over an area too large to be from the 370. A good bet is the course was plotted for the Kerguelen islands and it ran out of fuel. It closely matches both the satellite data and the estimated amount of fuel on board. They need to release more data from other known flights in order to verify their satellite based calculations are accurately consistent and also calculate average error in predicted locations of known flights. This would tell everyone how reliable and precise the satellite method is. I.e. if calculated flight paths for 7 other flights all matched their known locations to +/- 3 miles, then we would know the satellite method is accurate to 3 miles.

still doesnt make sense, if it simply ran out of fuel, then the pilots would have been aware that they have little fuel left and would have radioed

"between the aircraft and a satellite suggested the plane crashed into the sea because it ran out of fuel" Seriously... ran out of fuel. Was the pilot stoned or something, should that not be one of the most important things to check- so let me get this strait,, he took off and flew the plane over the ocean never once checking the fuel meter. What was the purpose of the Co-pilot?? So it sounds to me that when the plane was going down- the pilot said: Whats wrong, losing stability of the plane, , it could be the engine sir,, o no wait, we forgot to fuel up. Huh?? Doesn't make sense to me.

Ran out of FUEL? Really.... if that was the case, why no may day calls afterwards...dead silence is not of a plane that is out of fuel...

Hank ... the data is there. 1) exact time fuel ran out 2) exact times the jet intersected 6 separate arcs. 3) assuming the jet was on a heading, altitude, and airspeed, there are only a series of linear routes it could be on for the last 6 hours. (assuming the jet autopilot settings were not changed the last 6 hours is a reasonable assumption) 4) the Doppler shift in the last 6 received satellite pings show the aircraft was headed south. What's more, Inmarsat had a plot of several southerly routes and how close each route matched the Doppler shifts for the last 6 pings. The closest matching route was to the west of the current search area. In order to intersect the 6 arcs at the right times, they also could tell what the airspeed would have to be for each of the linear routes. The farther west the route, the faster the plane was traveling and the farther south it reached. Since the time is known when the fuel ran out, one can calculate backwards for each route with it's own airspeed, what altitude it must have been at in order to use up the fuel at that known time for that altitude and airspeed. Thus, for each route, the altitude, airspeed, heading and location is derived. The original predicted location for splash that most closely matched the Doppler shift put the final point about 1000 miles southwest of the current search zone. All the data is available to identify the right search zone and it is not where they are now looking. ps, the best fit route appears to be headed directly for Kerguelen Island which may be what the pilot entered into the autopilot as a destination for a possible safe water landing on the large lake near the shore to escape detection and survive. This post script is conjecture since the pilot would have errored to think he could reach it. But if the route proves to be at the most efficient altitude and airspeed, then it certainly has credibility.

The article is not talking about black box pings. It's talking about the engine maintenance satellite pings.

Why would the plane's computer power up again after losing fuel? If the plane runs out of fuel, the computer STILL KEEPS RUNNING. A shutdown only happen if the plane landed and was shutdown...satcom may have been disabled shortly afterwards. Fuel interruption would NOT cause the computer to go down...those computers run on inverters and battery power, not fuel. So the computer would NOT say interruption due to fuel exhaustion. It was STAY RUNNING and report the actual event of fuel exhaustion. So the fuel exhaustion claim is totally BOGUS!

It is my opinion that the batteries that were being carried by this air craft started a fire. The fire got out of control and the pilot went to 45,000 feet to deprive the fire oxygen, unfortunately this was a electrical fire and will not stop burning. The pilot brought the plane back down to a lower altitude and tried to change course so as to be able to land at the closest air port. The pilots apparently passed out as a result of the smoke and the plane flew until it ran out of fuel with everyone on board probable already dead from smoke inhalation.

The fact is that no one really knows exactly what happened and perhaps the world will never know the true details--everyone get along with the business of living.

Only God knows what happened to that plane. Now they are trying to act like they know what happened. The only thing that I am sure of is that they are clueless

The world will never know the truth about what really happen to flight MH370 because the Malaysian government and governments of the other nationalities of the passengers onboard the doomed flight, do not want us to know. My theory is, there has been an exchange of these people onboard flight MH370 for other worldly beings, not of this world. Yep, I know many will say, Wyatt your crazy, right? Well, if someone has a better theroy then mind and these stupid governments and so called experts that say MH370 ran out of fuel, #$%$", I say give it up.

One fact for sure since this happened, with all the many nations and them that think they know all the answers? this issue has them stumped. All they can say is nothing more than speculate. Who and how this was pulled off if ever found out how it happened, will surly make a great movie, even if the truth is never............found out. I hope the needed information will be recovered and the true facts told. My worst worry of who thought this up and truly hope they gain no power of management of a population any where on this planet. Lord God I pray, we find these evil people amen.

Jackson Stiles -- I notice that just about every reply you post is about the commenter's intelligence. How about acknowledging that everyone has an opinion about what happened to this plane and its passengers, and that people can believe or not believe whatever story they wish, and it has nothing to do with their IQ. Personally, I find it to be rather interesting hearing about the various theories, and I don't think people are "dumb" for thinking that this or that happened to the plane. Until we know for sure, ALL possibilities are viable.

Someone with your sensitivity (or lack of it) doesn't seem to get it Un-Nuts!!! The families of 239 people would disagree with you. They want to know what happened to their loved ones!!! And IF those passengers perished, of which I have no doubt at this point, those families STILL need closure knothead!!!

The only thing certain; none of the populace knows where that thing is at. The one thing I do know; someone in the government knows what happened.

Don't laugh people.... one never knows.... this idea has been talked about since the thing disappeared... I'm not a conspiracy person but this scenario could be the case. How in the world do you lose a jet this big? Answer: you don't....

it's on the "highway to heaven"

@ Harry Bailey : Not in this lifetime .

this is a big cover up

more proof there was a cover up

It's all 8ull $hyt! Cover up!

CNN needs to cover this more closely.

This should give CNN several more weeks of coverage.

CNN will be very sad when this is all over.

Where is CNN, this is breaking news?
