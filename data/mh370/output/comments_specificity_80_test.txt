MH-370 will never be traced or found so long as super power and super police of world shall not be grilled. I am wondering why china is not keep to trace it?

the REASON THIS PLANE WENT DOWN was from natural EMP burst released from the tectonically active region below. The Sunda plate is sinking and the elites know it! That's why the search was distracted into the wrong waters. They didn't want you all figuring it out if more search planes went down in the same area. Most of you didn't catch the news blip in the Times about a SECOND MH flight nearly going down on the SAME EXACT FLIGHT PATH weeks later. Same reason, electrical failure. Only their aux power saved them long enough to emergency land in HK. Their brothers on MH370 died in the air due to loss of cabin pressure before diving into the ocean. This was not the fault of pilots, Malaysian gov't, or any human involved. Get over yourselves. The tectonic plates are acting up for one very big reason and it's not the Sun. Do you research.

Isn't this going to give hijackers even more information about how to elude tracking systems? Perhaps they already anticipated pinging the satellite with info showing they were heading south when really they were going NW--into a Muslim country in a former Soviet state where it can be refitted and used in a future attack (hopefully not with some of the kinds of deadly materials that come to mind). Not to be a pessimist, but nothing else really makes any sense.

Countries are discreet about what can track from space ...But you can bet a few were able see where this plane ended up..... .National security will always prevail

knowing that you only have 30 days or so before the pings die out, after the first week passed they should have went into alert and did everything possible to find the location using all this data that is just now being released. They worked like they knew they were going to find the plane and not seem to have a very good searching protocol in such situations to avoid this kind of scenario. We are paying these idiots way too much money for the jobs they do beginning with the airlines that have a 19th century tracking system and ending with the stupid Malaysian military which did nothing after spotting the plane changing direction

boeing and rolls Royce both contacted the pentagon shortly after the plane went missing, and told them thru tracking assets they have on the plane, that it landed in a south Pakistan airbase. the pentagon response was,, "no it didn't!" then, that whole story was quashed. hmm, im wondering why? maybe its being retro fitted to be used in another attack.

Exactly Lessismore!!! Danny apparently was at least a little interested in what the article had to say.....OR...his whole intention was simply to come straight to the comment section just to add a "hateful, insensitive" remark!!! Either way, his comment makes him a imbecile!!!

Actually, no jets were ever scrambled. The head of the airforce here in Malaysia stated that nothing was deployed since the object appearing on the military radar seemed "non hostile". Basically, no action was taken.

Yes that base was established to monitor both air traffic and ballistic possibilities over both Russia and the middle east covering thousands of miles north in the 1990's, they know every single movement made in the air. This base according to my brother who was stationed there in from 2011- 2012 had a complete radar makeover by Raytheon and no one was allowed 500 yards from where they were installing pallets of equipment. Guys on the base were rumored that this new equipment could track any air traffic anywhere in the world.

From the ineptitude i've seen so far, they have more chances of finding Amelia Earhart's Lockheed Electra Model 10 than this flight. Oh you say they found her plane? SEE?

Hamzah please explain Malaysia's concept of " ketuanan melayu " or " malay superiority " as enshrined in Malaysia's federal constitution and the concept of " Bumiputra " or " the prince of the land " status accorded to you malays which sounds alot like the "aryan race" concept of the #$%$ and also the special rights of the malays in multicultural malaysia (70% malay , 20% chinese , 5 % indians , 5% others ) to the worldwide community and let them be the judge of whether Malaysia is racist or not . Please explain your racial quotas that strictly set 60% of places in universities must go to the malays regardless of their qualifications and the other 40% is open to all races including the malays . Please explain the setting up of Universities (UiTM) , vocational institutes (IKM , Giatmara , IKBN ) and scholarships where the general entry requirement is that you are a malay and at the exclusion of all other minority races . Please explain why only malays (regardless of whether they are rich or poor ) get a compulsory 10% discount when they purchase a property whilst the minority races have to pay the full price even if they are poor and also why the minority races get to purchase only leasehold land whilst the malays get the freehold land . Please explain the malaysian's government policy of not allowing any new chinese or indian schools to be built even if they don't ask a cent from the government to which they pay the majority of income tax to . Please explain Malaysia's federal constitution stipulation that only a malay can ever become the prime minister , deputy prime minister , finance minister , defence minister , home minister , menteri besar and all " sensitive areas " which is strictly prohibited of other minority races . Please explain Malaysia's labour law which stipulates that 70% of hired labor in any organisation (whether public or private or government owned ) must be malay even though there are no qualified malay . Please explain Malaysia's corporate law that 30% of equity in public listed companies on the Bursa Malaysia or Malaysia stock exchange must be donated to the malays via a trust fund (Permodalan Nasional Berhad). Please explain why all government tenders for projects stipulates that the company vying for the projects must be malay companies and that a government department was set up to vet all such tenders to ensure the companies are malay companies and also the Class F contractors who must be malay contractors in order to tender for small government projects . Please explain why all contractors of Petronas ( the national oil company ) and all government link companies must be malay contractors regardless of their qualifications .

Please explain the 2 hours break time every friday and five times a day from work that is compulsory to be given to all malay muslims ONLY in order for them to pray which is not accorded to people of other faiths and religion . Please explain the government's funding of the construction of mosques for the muslim malays only and NOT to churches , temples or places of worship for devotees of other religion and the refusal of the local councils to grant approval for the construction of such other places of worship by the minority devotees themselves at their own expense using their own funds and land . Please explain the government's health policy of only requiring compulsory HIV testing for malay couples wishing to get married and not couples of other minority races . Hamzah when you can explain all the above then you can look me in the eye call me a " pendatang " ( a derogatory term meaning visitor frequently used by malays to describe fellow non malay malaysians who are 3rd generation or more ) and tell me that I am wrong about Malaysia being a racist , apartheid and anti-semitic state ruled by a corrupt regime , and that I should migrate to Australia if I disagree with Malaysia's " New Economic Policy " or the affirmative action for the majority malays .

The plane did not crash. They would have been able to find some debris some where on the surface or washed up on nearby islands. Now, if I'm wrong, then that means those investigating aren't smarter than a fifth grader which should #$%$ off the families of the missing people. If they're lying, then that should also #$%$ off the families. Either way, the families have a right to be #$%$ off and should be calling for heads to roll in their government, in the airline, and in international agencies involved in the investigation.

Given how inept and secretive the Malaysians are, I still think it's possible the plane is sitting on the tarmac waiting for clearance by Malaysia authorities to return to the gate.

This had been reported on before. the Malaysian military claims to have seen it on radar, but did not believe it to be a threat. As such, no reason to scramble fighters, etc. It turns out that the military was correct - it wasn;t a threat to the national security of Malaysia (or for that matter - assessments made by any other countries - the same).

Malaysian authorities REFUSED to investigate the findings of a private company that found wreckage similar to that of a sizable plane. That's not investigation. And you thought I was the one needing to pay attention.

When they finally find this plane in a few years, and realize it was simply lost in a vast ocean that a reckless and inept govt was too ignorant to ask for help with before it was too late, all the conspiracy theorists will be sad that it was a plane crash that only seemed mysterious because of the bumbling Malaysian govt. Remember how long it took to find the Air france flight? And they even knew where that one went down...now imagine having no idea where to start looking.

boeing and rolls Royce both contacted the pentagon shortly after the plane went missing, and told them thru tracking assets they have on the plane, that it landed in a south Pakistan airbase. the pentagon response was,, "no it didn't!" then, that whole story was quashed. hmm, im wondering why? maybe its being retro fitted to be used in another attack.

Alan, based on yahoo commenter's, I am neither shocked or surprised.

shut up with your conspiracy theories, besides 9/11 attack was planned by our government no terrorist flew planes into buildings that day. So much evidence to back it up.

what we know for sure is that the Malaysian gov't did not want this plane found - they did everything humanly possible to delay, mislead and misdirect the search. the question is ------------- why?

it's on the "highway to heaven"

@ Harry Bailey : Not in this lifetime .

about the same as you graduating 3rd grade

his *** should have swallowed him

Anamjem, fix your caps lock k?

First of all, are we certain that the 47 pages of data are not tampered before? no one at this point has finish analysising these page of data to confirm it is not a cooked data. so technically saying it is RAW data is incorrect

If that data can be released now, why could it not have been released back then?

"This could have been released weeks ago and as others have pointed out, only a small fraction of it is even applicable." I suppose you wanted the raw data edited so that only applicable data was released.

@Loius Religion is not a race.

No, but releasing the raw data just confuses people but shows they released something...
