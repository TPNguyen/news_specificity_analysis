Cell phones don't work as you climb out, and there are no cell towers out at sea.

None of those cell phones work when there are no towers...and there are no towers in the ocean.

3 months, huh....move along, nothing going on here!

It's all 8ull $hyt! Cover up!

Tell us something we don't already know!

more proof there was a cover up

this is a big cover up

Only 3 months later??? Totally not suspicious

The article is not talking about black box pings. It's talking about the engine maintenance satellite pings.

The Malaysian government is more transparent than the Obama regime!

8-Ball....there were many books and stories based on the Bermuda Triangle too. Yet many of those were later proven to have been embellished by mere speculation, and therefore not containing actual "facts"!!!

See sueethel for a good time

Damn how sad, its been so long I actually forgot about the missing plane.

Malaysia is one of the most backward country in Asia...what do you expect...I thought it would take decades to release this bs data...hey they came up in 3 months....that's progress I say

better let the experts handle it instead of letting the families stick there nose in it. stop being a pain in the ace people, your just wasting money and time for rescuers

What a shame they cant find the plane that had 4 of the 5 patent holders that shared rites to a semiconductor with Rockerfeller. Poor guy will have to spend all those billions by himself.

I wonder how many years it will take before people say what plane?

took them that long to "doctor" the facts?

quick, we are losing our time on news channels, Release more stats about the plane!

The "media"...couple of months ago...10 - 15 articles A DAY on this...they have moved on and now lucky to see one...and yet no answer to missing plane. But there must be 20 articles on the shooting in California - this week. Next week they will move on to the next tragedy and flood the "news" with that for a week...

What happened on Flight 370 was much worse than what happened on Flight 360. What do you think?

You have no idea what you are talking about
