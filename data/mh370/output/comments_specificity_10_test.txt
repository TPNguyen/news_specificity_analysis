we now know that a UFO did not zap them away.
NASA is very good at the recovery aspect Barry.

because its all under the ocean....

If they don't find any more parts or debris from this plane, it will be an even bigger mystery. For a piece this big to be knocked loose from the plane, there should be thousands of pieces of debris floating out there, if they don't find much else then you have to ask the question why not.

I'm shocked - I was really thinking this was from the other 777 which crashed...

Or one civilian without the benefits of union pay.... There is only ONE 777 missing in that part of the world. Right ?

Did not take a 187 experts to reach this conclusion. A team of five from Boeing would have done the trick.

I will try hold my tongue until the actual plane is found.

Canned Heat has a pickled brain....................

Maybe if you'd educate yourself you would realize they tracked it after it blew up.In other words...IT WAS IN THE OCEAN.Try reading and UNDERSTANDING before you type.

PB53044 - They will still need to find the main wreckage and determine the cause. Boeing needs to know if they need to recall any parts or change maintenance schedules/routines. Look at Air France Flight 447. While they removed the first major wreckage and two bodies from the sea within five days of the accident, they didn't find the aircraft's black boxes until nearly two years later.

Well theory that terrorists hijacked this plane for the 20 plus Freescale Semiconductor employees that were on board and their hi-tech computer chips and samples still makes a lot of sense to me.... which country actually did it I would not know, but Russia or Iran would be a couple logical guesses... unfortunately you can only read about these chip designers being on the plane in foreign newspapers, which is a good indicator that the US government used its power from the Patriot Act to suppress this news for national security reasons.... why else would they suppress news if there is not something to hide???? Whoever kidnapped these people did not want the plane traced back to them, so i suspect they put it in the most remote part of the ocean they could find... it probably would have been a soft landing as the pilot(s) would possible try to save himself or be saved a submarine.... the condition of this piece seems to indicate a soft water landing, which rules out many other technical failings like incapacitated pilot theory or loss of cabin pressure which would have ended in a crash without fuel... unfortunately the people who know are never going to tell us the truth because it makes our leaders look like what they are: IDIOTS....

@Matt I hear ya. I read a conspiracy theory where the plane was landed in Myrmar where north koreans sent a "cargo" ship with uranium. And that terrorists were going to fill the plane with that uranium and use it as a guided missile against the US. With a missing wing, doubt that's gonna happen anytime soon. This does, however, blow a huge hole into my alien hijacking/abduction theory. Bummer, I like that one the best.

Or that was just some debris planted by the ones that are covering it up just to satisfy the sheeple that believe everything on TV.

frank, i think that may be correct, a mathematician has already shown how the plane could go underwater intact (without breaking up)

Matt, you can't abduct an airplane as it is not a human being. The correct term for a terrorist taking an airplane by force is hijacking. Also we know there is a part that has shown up on a beach, that does not mean the rest of the plane is in the water. Based on the lack of any other debris from this plane or the fact that ZERO bodies have been found gives me doubt as to this planes demise as having crashed into the ocean. Obviously this part was torn from the airplane, so if it did go down into the ocean it wasn't a miracle on the Hudson soft landing, so where is the rest of it? No seats, no bodies, no other parts except for this one have floated onto any shores. I'm just a tad bit reserved about this discovery, I will wait until a lot more of that plane starts showing up on beaches before drawing a conclusion.

Well, RJT, let's think about it. The plane, it is believed, crashed quite some distance away, 16 months ago. You ever walk on a beach? All kinds of garbage washes up all the time. It would take a) an object like a wing that is readily identifiable, b) some person that is smart enough to find it and associate the item on the beach to a plane crash from 16 mos ago. c) that person then would have to care enough to report it, d) the person that they report it to has to also pass it along to a competent person. A flaperon - sure. Water bottles, clothing or part of an old suitcase, seat cushion? - all of that stuff looks like junk that washes up from boats all the time.

One way to help pinpoint where flight MH370 may have crashed is to release tennis balls injected with water to increase their specific gravity and label the tennis balls with the release sight, date of release and where they were found when near were the part of the airliner was found. A large amount of tennis balls could be used inexpensively and give searchers an idea where to look for the lost airliners.

What makes you think they needed the aircraft?

I don't believe this. The real plane was zapped by aliens for human experiments. Someone is trying to cover something up. The aliens are coming, and coming soon. They won't be in human form either. We are in for some scary times. Wonder what type of experiments they are doing on them.

Stay tuned for 24/7 coverage from CNN...

@West. It does, want to know why? Because everyone who believe terrorists were involved, believe the plane was sitting in a hanger somewhere and the people were still alive. Having debris with barnicales on it, means it has been in the ocean for a long time. Matching a planes wing with a serial number on it, means it came from that plane.

I guess there are that many idiots in this country... THE PLANE CRASHED! NO TERRORISTS!

ahh because the only thing terrorist do is park a plane in a hanger. they dont crash then into buildings or the ocean correct? maybe you need to lay off the crack, crackbaby!

matt reads one theory and believes thats the only one people have. Welcome to reality Matt, where there are thousands of theories dumb dumb

Matt, you can't abduct an airplane as it is not a human being. The correct term for a terrorist taking an airplane by force is hijacking.

OK......LOL! I am talking about the conspiracy theory where everyone is alive and the plane was in a hanger. This is what everyone believed, not that terrorists hijacked the plane and crashed it into the ocean! That is just now becoming a theory after this was released! This is not what those people believed.

That doesn't mean it wasn't taken by terrorists moron.

Matt, clearly you're the idiot... Just because the wing was found doesn't definitively exclude terrorist activity. Sure, it probably kills the theory that the plan was stolen by terrorists, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that they had something to do with crashing it.

Again, the theory was never that terrorists hijacked the plane and crashed it, correct???????????? The theory was it was 'hijacked' and the plane was in a hanger somewhere. Maybe I should have reworded my answer.... This is when there is no plane debris found. NOW IT IS A THEORY THAT TERRORISTS HIJACKED THE PLANE AND CRASHED IT! That was not the case when no debris was found...
