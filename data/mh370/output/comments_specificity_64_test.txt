Pretty obvious. I hope Putin is keeping a nice laundry list of all the things the NWO have served up.

satellite does not look at the entire world at one time. Go look through some binoculars. About the same concept. You see only what you are looking at.

And then after that? 60,000 miles? A $50 Million? and nothing? Seems silly. Spend it on pilot education in KL mate.

Why are Australian taxpayers footing this bill? This is Malaysia's issue plain and simple.

This plane is probably still sitting on a ramp in Kazakhstan...new paint and interior...waiting for the highest terrorist bid to take her away. Many planes go missing every year, although without the number of passengers and mystery. This one will be seen again I believe.

The Americans have been unusually quiet. There was something on board that plane that China desperately wanted. This is why the plane will NEVER be found!

Australia has spent a fortune trying to find this plane ( spent a lot of money before the budget and $89M was in the budged) and is committed to paying 50% of the cost of the next area to be searched. It is over a year now since the plane disappeared and there's a high possibility that the plane didn't crash in this area. Why are the Chinese government not contributing to the next search? Australia has been the biggest contributor. Tony Abbott was a fool to say that we would search until the plane is found. This may never happen.

These Idiots couldn't find their own Butts if they weren't sitting on them.

Well, at least they'll gain the seafloor maps out of the deal! Of Course, the Chinese will immediately claim it all as part of "Greater China"!

The intriguing part is transponders etc were turned off Next is China not known for involvement in plane searches and the US is usually involved but not in this case. There must have been something on the plane that China badly needs and the US has been extraordinarily quiet. The plane didn't crash in the search area. Like my previous prediction that nothing will be found and the search area will be widened but again the plane will not be found

They continue to look in the wrong location. They need to search in northern Pakistan.

Millions spent on finding this plane . I'll bet there looking in the wrong area !!! Challenger Deep / Mariana Trench Is 35 , 840 feet Deep , That's over 6 . 7 miles deep , Straight down to Pacific bottom ocean floor ! At 35,840 Ft. Equals : 16,000 P.S.I , That pressure will " Crush " anything !!!

Don - You are correct. They should be looking only in the area where the plane is.

Considering they've found air wreckages over 75 years old, why not? Polymers protect parts from corroding

De Plane is at Bloughfeldt's secret island compound.

I have been spreading the truth that Guido Westerwelle is the Biblical anti-christ for over the last 18 months after the Lord Jesus Christ revealed this to me.

#$%$, he is dying of cancer...this is the second time you've been caught spreading this nonsense. btw, do you think the anti-christ was homosexual?

I still think the plane is down there somewhere.. Maybe the plane went down in the ocean without leaving any debris.. who knows. And I don't think the plane went to the Indian Ocean as assumed by the experts. I still think it went down on its original route to China. Everything is possible.

Pretty obvious. I hope Putin is keeping a nice laundry list of all the things the NWO have served up.

I bet nothing has been done to have passenger jets more effectively tracked & found. Former German politician Guido Westerwelle will be European Union leader after the rapture. He is the Biblical anti-christ. he will sign a 7 year agreement which is the official start of the Biblical 7 year tribulation, Daniel 9:27. Halfway thru the 7 year tribulation Guido Westerwelle will claim to be god after a mortal head wound. Revelation 13:3.

Well. You're a special kind of crazy, aren't you?
