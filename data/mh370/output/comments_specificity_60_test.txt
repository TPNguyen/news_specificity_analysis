i doubt they would hide a terrorist attack. russia is evil but the plane was awful far away from russia to have that seem likely.

why would they hide or keep secret the facts. Only a few reasonable reasons. Terrorist attack from within the plane or outside of plane. Missile attack. Why is one man claiming that Russia knows and has the remains of the plane? What does Russia have to do with this?

They're not going to find it because the plane is sitting in some hangar in Russia.

The Malaysian government doesn't care. They'll just keep screwing around to make it look like they're doing something. Sounds a lot like the government of another country we all know.

I believe that these people are still alive. If it would have crashed in the water you would have found something afloat 1, 2 if it crashed on land they would have seen the fire and smoke. They were Hijacked. Plain and simple.

I just wish that they would look where the lane actually disappeared lol not 1000's of miles away smoke and mirrors jumbo jets cannot ahem CANNOT disappear off radar no matter what they shut off on the plane radar doesn't work that way. If that were the case any country could fly a bomb to the U.S. invisibly

If someone had hijacked and stolen the plane they would have announced it to display their power.

Malaysia has made too many mistakes regarding this investigation and I am one obsessed intrigued person about this case. Malaysia never monitored plane and gave too many directions the first 2 weeks and were never honest. By the 3rd week we found out that when the plane turned it was low enough that they received a signal from one of the towers and that was from the young pilot. What they'll find out if they will ever find out is that the head pilot did it and probably locked the young pilot out of the cockpit. He didn't want to fly with the young pilot (that was made clear). The head pilot looked stable in his younger years but something didn't look right about him when he got older. Asians can lie well and have less facial expression because of their less pronounced profile. The more pronounced your face is the more expressive your face is. Its not mean its about the muscles of the face and bones structure. They can be great liars. They made too many mistakes and going back and forth with information and then with holding. Its a poor place that makes money on tourism. And now to hear that the black box the battery may have expired months before the plane crash, always hiding and withholding info, sorry poor countries do that when they rely on tourism to survive.

After watching and reading all the possible theories and scenarios about the cause of the missing of flight 370, I come to the conclusion in my opinion that, this has to be an deliberate act, nothing else, either the cockpit was breached by someone with knowledge of how to operate a jet liner, or 1 or both pilots deliberately flies the plane off course. What bothers me is that what are the motives?? If it's pilot suicide, then why go through all the trouble and fly another 7 hours just to crash into the Indian Ocean? doesn't make sense. If the plane was hijacked, what are the demands? which terrorist group are responsible? I guess we will never know what really happened, all I can say is it's deliberate, but for what purpose remains unknown.

1 year ago .... MHL 370 went missing ..... they still have not found it .... I worked with a company back int the 70's and 80's that pioneered these warning systems on this aircraft and others.... many were designed to go off only when they hit water.... none did.... why.... I came to the conclusion days after that this aircraft never went into the water...... there is many strange things involving this disappearance ..... I personally believe this plane is on land in control of a government with ties to evil.... I also believe the US government is involved with it.... I believe this plane made a stop at at Diego Garcia.... and island owned by the US and England... and island designed to handle large military aircraft, even has under ground hangers ... could even hide a 777 ..... I believe this plane will make an evil appearance in future ..... I pray not......

Who will pick up the tab?

...then let them eat dust now.

So where do you think the people who were on it are at...Why do you think all this? Do you have a crystal Ball?

. These people eat dogs. .

let's get real, their loved ones sleep with the fishes.

thinking that the plane is somewhere besides the bottom of the ocean.

Do you even realize how offensive your comment is?

People never realize how big our oceans are.

The Chinese (h)ell of upside down airplanes. The Chinese have a lot of (h)ells...

COMPLAINT TO THE CIA THEY ARE THE ONES THAT DID THE JOB!
