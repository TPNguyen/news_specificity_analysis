Cawthorne bases his theory on an oil rig worker who says he saw a burning plane go down around the time the plane's transponder went off — and when the military exercise was reportedly in progress.
"The drill was to involve mock warfare on land, in water, and in the air, and would include live-fire exercises," Cawthorne writes.
He suggests the plane's disappearance is part of a massive international cover-up.
"Say a participant accidentally shot down Flight MH370," Cawthorne writes.
"Such things do happen.
No one wants another Lockerbie, so those involved would have every reason to keep quiet about it."
The author, who says he's written more than 150 books, posits that officials have been releasing misinformation in order to keep the plane from being found.
"Now I'm not saying that's what happened," Cawthorne writes, "but if a black box is found, who is to say that it is from Flight MH370?
Another black box could have been dropped in the sea 1,000 miles from Perth while the search was going on in the South China Sea.
In these circumstances, with the amount of disinformation abroad, it is best to be skeptical."
Not surprisingly, news of Cawthorne's book has angered some of the victims' family members.
Paul is hoping to attract investors to finance the drama, which he says will cost $3.5 million to produce.
