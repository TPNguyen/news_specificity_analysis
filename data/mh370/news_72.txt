British woman Katherine Tee is saying she spotted what she believes is the missing Malaysian Air flight MH370 while she was sailing.
She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time.
“It caught my attention because I had never seen a plane with orange lights before so I wondered what they were,” Tee said.
“It looked longer than planes usually do.
There was what appeared to be black smoke behind it.
Since that’s not something you see every day, I questioned my mind.
I was looking at what appeared to be an elongated plane glowing bright orange, with a trail of black smoke behind it.
It did occur to me that it might be a meteorite.
But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” The more interesting observation Tee made was that the plane was not alone.
“There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,” she said.
“They had normal navigation lights.
I remember thinking that if it was a plane on fire that I was seeing, the other aircraft would report it.” Since authorities still haven’t found the plane, Tee feels bad for not saying something sooner.
“Will this help the authorities of the families get closure?
I have no idea … but I chose to sweep it under the carpet and now I feel really bad,” she said.
”Maybe I should have had a little more confidence in myself.
I am sorry I didn’t take action sooner.” The search for the missing flight still continues.
