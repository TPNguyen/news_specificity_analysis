This whole article and fictional story could have been avoided with simply asking her to take a lie detector test.
it took her all this time to declare what she saw. there was a massive search on and a lot of guess work being done as to where the plane could have come down. in fact, very expensive search operations did take place in the indian ocean. i suppose her claims should be investigated. what i find strange is her claim that the rear section of the aircraft was on fire and that two aircrafts flew above the burning aircraft. only air force planes would fly in such formation. i think this adds to mystery. but, the pilot had the time to send out a distress call. it's not clicking, but the story needs to be checked out.
They need to get this lady, her story and position at the time and the oil rig workers story and letter that claimed he saw an explosion and fire in the sky along the MH 370 initial flight track together and check it out with lie detectors. It might be baloney, but it can't be much more suspect than the " pings " heard at " the crash site " we all were hoping located the plane, and they spent tens of millions and weeks on that. Rule it in, or rule it out.
She saw it but what about her husband? Didn't he see it? Didn't she bring it to his attention? There was orange lights on the plan and a trail of black smoke which makes me wonder about her brain. There is to much missing in this story and what is here is hard to believe. But what she said in the story makes me glad I'm not in trouble. If I was and she saw it I would know I wouldn't get any help.
When people sail, one person is on watch while the other sleeps which is why her husband wouldn't see it. I know because I sailed the Atlantic and was on watch many nights alone on deck while my partner rested. Beautiful (in good weather). Doesn't make her story true of course but she could have seen something while alone in the cockpit.
I don't think they get on very well, they've got different surnames!!
Fact is with all the money spent by people and agencies with the latest technological equipment available and still no one has been able to locate this aircraft. Anything and anyone may have a piece of information that may lead to locating this aircraft. I am a retired air traffic controller and I have felt from the beginning that it will take "Thinking [Well] Outside The Box" in determining what happened to MH370. Almost always one given factor has never brought down an aircraft, as in nearly all cases it is a combination of factors coming together that causes aircraft incidents and accidents. It will soon be discovered that something happened to MH370 that will cause a revision in aviation procedures and operations both in the cockpit and air traffic control to accommodate better handling of the factors that came together to bring this aircraft down.
look...the thing crashed.sad but true.whether she saw it or not.i know it's a tragedy,but things happen in life,and whenever we board a plane,we take that risk. there have been countless opinions about this flight,and i expect there will be interest in it for a very long time to come...after all,it's quite a tragedy. but today is just today,and anyone who looks for conspiricies,spirituality or any kind of sense or reason to life is throwing contentment right out the window.to me,it went down,and like mostly everything else in life,there's no more or less to it than what meets the eye.
The existance of the Mafia was once a conspiracy. The last seperate congressional investigation into the assassination of JFK concluded that a conspiracy was "highly likely". Every time they got a lead that "lead" was DEAD. The CIA conducted many tests on American Civilians to include: Project MK Ultra. You see, conspiracies do exist and they are very real. Anyone who ceases to believe the facts I just stated is simply ignorant. Read a history book in 40 years and you will see "some" truth come out. But also remember; "it is the victors who write history."
but pete...i know that there are lots of conspiracies,bad guys and sinister plans.i,in fact have multiple personalities,and can pull off a conspiracy all by myself... for one thing,i don't have anything thnose high level people or the mafia want...being out to get ME would be more of a waste of time than anything.and whoever would ever want to spy on me would fuind themselves to be really bored. so,as far as conspiricies,politics or spirituality go,if there's something out there,it will be there whether i'm "in tune" with it or not.i'll just vote for whatever candisates are anti illegal freeloader and pro deporto,keep in touch with god and jesus,and just call it that...and if there was indeed a plot,so be it.there's nothing i can do about it...i prefer peace and contentment to endlessly searchng fo answers. after all,i have never heard of an osterich on valuum.
This aircraft didn't just crash or explode, it was hijacked. Probably something to do with the 20 VIPs on board, or terrorists took it to use at a later date. Either way there's something very suspicious about the whole thing, a bit like the Diana crash....too many loose ends. They must think people are stupid!
This lady may have very-well seen something that day, which could have been the actual plane. In the military, I saw a huge meteor explode in the night's sky. No one else in the hanger I was in saw it. I was so excited that I yelled inside the hanger and told everyone. They all thought it was lightning because it was drizzling. Hours later, the flight crews returned from their sortie. As I debriefed the captain, I asked if he has seen anything out of the ordinary. He replied "You mean that meteor?" until it exploded." "We initially saw a bright light on what appeared to be a collision course with us" "We thought it was another plane heading right for us." As unfortunate as it sounds, planes do crash and people do die. I feel sorry for the passengers and crew as well as their loved ones. Even if it were my loved one on that flight I would accept that she is dead and miss them with all of my heart. The ocean is a big place and currents constantly flow.
You must be one of the stupid people I was talking about in my earlier post!
TONY R, I must be. Whatever your definition is I am PROUD to wear it because fools define the world by their ridiculous, lowbrow standards every hour, of every day of the week. I AM PROUD TO BE STUPID IN TONY R's EYES! Your extremely inadequate definition does not define me. Rather, it defines the type of person you are of which you may not have the IQ needed to be ashamed. Enjoy your bliss!!!
I was driving to work one morning around 6am and saw a meteor shower, it was so cool and unexpected. No one else I know saw it and there was nothing in the news about it. I know I wasn't seeing things. Makes me crazy that no one else got to see it. Maybe God planned that one special for me.
Sorry but to the person that stated that the flames would in fact make the smoke trailing very visible in the night sky. This is not true. I spent many years out at sea in the Navy and I have see some big fires. It is so black out there you can't see anything past the edge of the fire unless you are right next to it and then you can only see it for a few feet. This woman is a liar.
A 777 has between 315 to 451 seats and all the seat cushions are floatation devises, plus what ever else floats! All the resources that have been used to find this aircraft and not one piece of floating debris has been found????? Hello of course shes a liar piece of s***
it was crashed into the Southern Indian Ocean gyre, mixed up with many square miles of accumulated floating debris that can't be penetrated by ships nor differentiated from by air observation with the possible exception of drone aircraft, which need to be operated from surface ships and flown close to water level. eventually, as with the Air France plane, some identifiable objects will be found, somewhere.
she is just trying to be on the news.
maybe it was a full moon.
What was she drinking on that night?? or may be Smoking??
wow shipmate, how many aircraft have you seen get shot down? Subject matter expert are yah?
@Billy, 10 years in the Navy and 27 years at Boeing. Go home little man.
absent any verifiable evidence of what actually happened to MH370, she's no more or less a credible witness to the events she describes than any other observer or officials who were monitoring radar/radio transmissions of that and other flights in the region at the time. until we ever have a complete accounting of the fate of MH370, her experience is one of many official and unofficial reports to go into the file and has about equal weight to any of them.
Lie detector test, a little late to be telling such a story. As a lawyer, you don't have to be one to be totally suspicious of this absurdity. No Camera on an expensive vessel, no witnesses to video, no telephone cameras, this a huge aircraft second only to the A380. It would take a long time to descend as she described. Furthermore, the crew would have directed the vessel to the crash site immediately. Blue water sailing (I'm a retired maritime lawyer) has enough equipment to get the whole World to the alleged general location. Parts would be everywhere for miles on end.
Supposedly it was her and husband that were the only ones aboard the boat. I do agree with you though.
the lady herself called it. I must be hallucinating, I must be insane. Who says this so many times at the sight of a plane that's "slightly elongated" whatever that means and in trouble, maybe you'd use your phone to take a pic maybe not if you're older but she just.... sounds ditzy. When I see something surprising, unexpected, hard to believe, I don't assume I'm insane. Maybe if I saw Sasquatch.
Maritime law - it is a mariner's responsibility to try and help any vessel in trouble. Any thought of reporting this to the authorities? if you were a responsible boater you would. If you are a flaming sack of dudu well.... see above article...
I agree that normal people don't go around making public statements that they just thought they were insane or hallucinating. She's probably hallucinating.
She thought she was hallucinating? That means she had been drinking.
Was there a point for that joke of an animated simulation of events?
Lady, you shall have yahoo to thank for airing your story on time, for you might live a more fulfilling life as i think we have caught your schizophrenia at the most opportune moment. Kindly get the diagnosis confirmed.
She probably saw Elvis out there too.
Ocean would be full of debris for . The plane landed safely in East Cleveland Ohio and all on board were eaten alive.
Too late to say anything, ma'am...
Why is this being reported as news? It makes no sense at all. This woman was obviously either sun-struck, doped or pickled.
It's keeping our minds off 5 terrorist being released illegals, Nancy Pelosi calling for single payer health insurance, Benghazi, 20 million criminal invaders, a DEBT that is insurmountable and all the other unimportant things the media deems not to report.
The shortest distance between to points may be a straight line but, all airspace vehicles must follow set flight paths / way points while in transit or risk being shot down. Well what I think happened may be true. A pilot was hijacking this plane and hijacked another planes transponder code to evade radar detection as long as possible. He flew out of his schedule flight path and once he entered into international waters, while broadcasting the signal of a plane heading in another direction, he was taken for either a spy plane or terrorist. Then "A" country in the region shot him down to protect their soil from suspected terrorist/spies. Maybe this is why she saw, 1. A plane with flames and trailing smoke 2. Two other planes, fighter jets perhaps, above watching the target crash. Now if this did happen who in their right mind would tell China, WE just shot down a airliner full of innocent Chinese citizens?
which country would have shot it down do you think? Interesting theory. Wld the country that shot it down clean up the debris somehow without anyone noticing?
i'v thought that since the beginning, the plain was High jacked, you nailed it, with all the different stories kept changing ,it's a cover up!
Well, regardless of if she fabricated her story or not, this woman did get her 15 minutes of fame...
I'm going to go with her assessment of herself. She is insane! We are insane to bother thinking twice about this article. I'm insane for writing a comment about a bunch of insane gibberish. That's it.. I must be insane!
How about the yahoo crew that brought this "dish" to our screens are are even paid for it?
This should help CNN go for another six months.
So there was this things going around the internet saying that the plane was shot down because it was hijacked and heading to Diego Garcia where we have very sophisticated equipment and radar..... just saying'. It is sort of funny though - I guess I would think I was a little off if I saw a glowing plane.
Find it difficult to believe her. Why it has taken tell so long to tell it?
From History as an African Man we have never heard water retaining human bodies after one drowns in water whether fresh or salty water!The water respect dead body and don't hold it after death, the body will float automatically and be swept to the banks or shore but to date nobody has reported to have seen human body not even in Kenya or Zanzibar where most bodies are found along Jacaranda Indian Ocean Beach Resort!These people are alive believe me or not from my theory as its practical!The plane didn't vanish in the Ocean!Its somewhere stop telling us lies!
IF the plane wasn't diverted for a CIA covert op, it might have been shot down by said CIA. If there were 2 planes above it, and they did NOT report the plane, then they were probably the shooters (and that might explain why no 'Mayday' radio call). If the plane caught fire because of some system malfunction, there are enough redundant systems, fire suppression, etc., to allow them to get off at least one radio call. If it was shot down, they would not have that chance. And if the plane WAS on fire, it WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN by the other jets. I've seen the exact image TEe describes, and it's easy to tell a fire by the ORANGE GLOW. So no report from the planes means... GUILTY!
it is funny that anything unexplained must be a cia covert operation, what a fool
This woman needs to have another drink.
You don't leave it for George,you always do it.You saw it,you report it,don't say or think,Let George do it.They should have known their approximate location to report it to authorities,although by now there is no chance for survivors or debris.
I heard a guy say he saw it land somewhere in Arizona at a abandoned airbase. Yea I saw mickey mouse in a superman suit land in battery park.
In the absence of any other logical explanation regarding the MH370, I think the authorities should pursue this information and determine whether she too much to drink or she really saw something worthwhile. If she is full of sh..t, the authorities should be able to find that out. Maybe the other two planes she saw were Chinese fighter jets which shot down the airliner.
The reason that I do not believe this woman saw a very large plane on fire is the fact it is doubtful she would have lost sight of it before it crashed on the open ocean with nothing to obstruct her view. Are telling me this thing somehow flew out of site without her seeing it go down? Not likely in my opinion. So for all of you that say on the open ocean at night with clear skies and moonlight you can easily see black smoke, tell how big planes are and how high they are why is it she does not say what happened to this plane? It flew so far past the spot she saw it on fire it went over the horizon? Not buying it.
I don't believe this woman, but just to give you a little background on science. The earth is curved, and even though there is nothing obstructing her view, the plane can go out of sight, if it exceeds the distance to the horizon measured by the following formula: SquareRoot(height above surface / 0.5736) = distance to horizon. So if her eyes were, say 5.5' off the surface of the water, then the horizon is about 3 miles away. If the plane crashed outside of that distance, then she would have lost sight of it. If the plane crashed 50 to 100 miles away, then she wouldn't see the smoke either.
Actually, the horizon is approximately 7 miles away from the observer at sea level. Every schoolchild knows this.
Well, she was sailing and the airplane was about 900km/h. How long it would take to desapear from sight even in level flight? Just a question!
Katherine Tee.. Shut up!.. why would she have reported this before? Why now is she saying it? Is she now getting paid on saying this and benefiting from others loss?? Oh and do like the model boat used in this article.... plane off course?? where is the interceptors? smoke in the sky.... other personnel would have seen and reported but only this woman has. there must have been other boats out there and no call to coast guard in the area reported? Maybe she want a new life as a kardashian or something.. Go away
It's hard for people who haven't been at sea for days in a small craft to understand but, you can start to go a little nuts out there.
Interesting! I'v neva been in the sea. And I can imagine how nuts u can be. And I'm thinking how so?
Don't you need a sail boat to sail? Or did the media just post a picture of a boat not knowing the difference?
Regardless, has anyone attempted to look where this lady said that her boat and the plane supposedly intersected?
She feels bad for not saying anything sooner? Really?
well sort of...I guess. Maybe shes too well off to have feelings.... For anyone but herself!
And just yesterday, she saw Elvis. Last week, it was Amelia Earhart. I bet she also knows where Flight 19 is, too.
: Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue. 21 of 21 found this interesting | Share this
Did she also tell you about the unicorn she saw in her backyard?
I have spent time sailing small boats at night in the open ocean. After several days and nights time and space become different than when on land with normal sensory input. Visual things can become very different and the mind interprets differently. I'm not saying this women had that experience but I know it can happen. For instance my wife who was with me was sure she saw a huge fire out in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico only to see the moon rise shortly there after.
I want some of what your wife was smokin!
The human mind is wonderous, but it is also not perfectly reliable especially when it is removed from it's routine experiences.
Totally agree with you Old Dude, have done a lot of open water power boating...Middle of Gulf of Mex. out in the Atlantic and crossed Atlantic a couple of time, Med and north Atlantic in the Navy seeing things that were there but not explainable by all onboard. Dead reckoning distance at night can be very very deceiving. Most the times running in open water I would run GPS or plot and Radar, no reason to look out, cannot see anything anyway....
Would someone please stop Grace from being able to cut and paste?
One would have to have experience on the water to understand what she is talking about. Maybe she thought she was dreaming. Sounds strange but this event has so many strange endings anyway.
Well, Old Dude, hope you didn't poke her too much about what she saw that night, because that is very like what happened to me many years ago, at 11 years of age. I was sleeping in a bedroom with two cousins, when I awoke in the night and thought the woods outside were on fire. I stared out the window a minute or so longer, and the glowing expanded, like an explosion, but I heard no sound. Just as I was about to wake the entire house, this enormous full moon broke the horizon - and my sanity was restored.
Exactly what I thought. After a few days at sea, sometimes people see things. I believe she saw the plane, and the other planes too. But, she knows, about seeing things.
Great posts from folks who have spent time on the open water. Thank you all for your information. It makes this woman's story seem very plausible.
The flight was at night. How can you see smoke? Another look at me personality.
It's too bad she took so long to come forward. Don't quite get that. But assuming she is right and putting this together with the underwater noises recorded by listening devises and that underwater engineering company that says they found outlines of a plane using a search for trace elements in the planes construction, and other info that the plan was indeed headed west, northwest and not south, this is as plausible as anything else. And whatever happened to the info that engineering company came out with after the Malaysian and Australian authorities chose not to look into it further? Was there ever a real effort made to look in the bay of Bengal?
You don't get that she's a complete idiot? I'm convinced that she waited months until her memory reached it's peak-recall ability.
What would have prevented the pilot from changing directions after he had crossed back over Malaysa heading southwest to make another change of direction to northwest after he knew he was out of radar range eventually ending up in the Bay of Bengal?
Rob, I saw the plane also, but it wasn't flames surrounding it, but rather a tractor beam from the other aircraft above it. The reason I didn't come forward sooner is because I thought people wouldn't believe me and mock me and make cry. I really hate when that happens.
I just remembered I saw the plane too. I didn't come forward earlier, because I hadn't remembered that I had seen a plane on fire. I think I was on twitter at the time, so my mind was too pre-occupied to process a burning plane flying by.
The investigation team should consider that too.
You have the BEST comment. You are hilarious!
If CNN gets ahold of this story, they'll probably milk the coverage for another 30 days.
With her lying #$%$! Who would see all that damn activity going on in that water and wouldn't either take some pics, video record it, and or call the authorities to report it!! She's full of it! She saw nothing, but I bet that she could tell you all of her neighbor's business b/c she always peep through her mini blinds at them!!
Wow, if Tee was not sure what she was witnessing why did she not ask her husband Marc to look and ask his opinion? Also, if she did witness the plane between India and Thailand then everyone is looking in the opposite wrong direction in the ocean. I do firmly believe that there is more to this tragedy than some governments are saying/telling...
I think so as well, that the info we received is as far from the truth as it could be.
Apparently, she and her husband were (according to her) not talking to each other for the past week. That's why she said nothing to him or pointed it out either. He was sleeping at the time.
She didn't say whether she discussed it with her husband or not, just that she was the one that witnessed it.
3 Months is a very long time to go without mentioning something this severe. Either it was medication she was taking or some she should be taking that probably caused this "sighting".. I hope that I am right about this because the thought of them being on fire and two other planes doing nothing to help them is not something I want to consider.
They were on a passage between two destinations, so they were on watches. One sleeps while the other mans the boat. Pretty standard procedure. Also, if you're on night watch, you can get pretty loopy and question what you are seeing.
She's probably just an attention seeker, and is making the whole thing up.
Maybe she was on her back looking up , and her husband was looking down. She didn't want to disturb him????
The fact that she doubted her own sanity says a lot about her mental state at the time. Maybe the two were fighting and under stress. Maybe she wasn't sleeping well. Our minds play funny tricks on us at night. Lots of maybes here, but no reason to call her an attention seeker. If she'd really wanted attention she would've brought this up as soon as she saw it. Attention seekers usually get really excited when they think they have a lure. I don't see someone who craves attention keeping this thing under wraps as long as she did.
B you can believe all you want. Doesn't make it the truth.
Coming from India, she was probably smoking hash.
Cross between narcissism, dementia, and possibly medication. People with these traits experience two events not related and then months after dwelling on it day in and day out, combine or alter them. Sometimes they have a dream and then months later it becomes a reality because it was so real. They actually convince themselves this really happened in front of their eyes. A lie detector test won't pick it up because she actually believes it. The reason this story took months to release is because it took months to foster and develop in her mind. Her husband couldn't have viewed it that night because it didn't exist that night.
In reply to tina concerning the two other aircraft seen by Ms Tee that night and why the pilots of those planes didn't report anything, It's not uncommon for pilots at cruising altitude in a low traffic density situation to not pay particular attention to what is outside the cockpit window, especially at night and far below them which was apparently the case in this situation. Civilian aircraft are only equipped with weather radar which might have shown a tiny blip but would have been of no concern as such small blips are common from such things as ships, oil rigs, or even small islands or atolls. They also would not have gotten a TCAS alert because the MH370 transponder was not working.
of course there's more to it than some countries are saying, there's more to it than those countries know. why is it when there's a mystery, it HAS to be a conspiracy? why does Animal Planet have a program called "Finding Bigfoot" and they never find one?? yet there seems to be a goodly number of Americans(more mysterious animal sightings than any other country) who believe Bigfoot exists, contrary to ANY physical evidence of a breeding population or corpses of naturally-deceased beasts? people choose to believe their imaginations, is why.
This is bulls^*t. Who automatically dismisses something as crazy seeing a fiery object falling from the sky and news reports of a missing plane?
She didn't see JACK ! Why did she wait so long to come forward, knowing how important it would be to assist search and rescue, seems a little far fetched and a media ploy.
All that we want from this publicity seeking idiot, is if she heard any premature, pings. Cut to the chase, fool!
Wow! And she reveals this 3 months later! If I thought I saw a plane on fire I would be panicking, trying to call for help, not hallucinating I think she's on meds Nice try though!
May I have permission, to treat the witness as CRAZY your honor?
Just another idiot looking for their 15 minutes.
That's nothing! I saw Elvis, Bruce Lee and an alien from outer space at the Sands Casino in Las Vegas yesterday.
yeah of course she did. Sounds like she's delirious from being at sea too long.
I understand Thai Stick will do that to you.
Pee test this one before wasting anymore time looking for a hijacked aircraft.
Something in the story doesn't make sense. She said that she looked up the flight plan of the aircraft and discovered that their journeys intersected. How could that be? The original flight plan was from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The course would not have taken the aircraft anywhere near Thailand. ?????
There's also mention this was witnessed at night. Would be interested to know around what time b/c if it's dark out, you're on the ocean with no light pollution, not sure how you could see a trail of black smoke.
I saw it flying down I90 near Chicago.
Say, that reminds me, I saw this corpse hanging out the window of a crashed Lockheed Electra, just sitting on the beach of this deserted island in the Pacific. It was holding a sign that said "I'm Amelia Earhart, send for help." Wonder if I should tell anyone? Nah, there's a bird flying overhead, it'll probably learn to talk and take care of that for me. Derp derp derp.
So how does a plane that is obviously on fire manage to fly all the way down to a remote part of the Indian Ocean, beaming back pings to a satellite all the while (another 5-6 hours?) And crossing her path with the "flight plan" seems a little iffy, as the plane deviated from the flight plan. Unless she meant to say "possible flight path" as reported in the news media after several weeks, once they nailed down the satellite handshakes. And even that was not 100% accurate.
leaking fuel from a small explosion rendering everyone unconscious is quite possible
Depends on WHERE she saw it doesn't it!!!
She was lying. Simple as that. No one would keep it a secret for that long.
It's not possible, the plane would have succumb to the laws of Thermodynamics within an hour or two. Simply put fire equals heat and heat equals energy as I stated on other posts. That airplane would have absorbed as much energy as it could before reached its breaking point and bursted into a giant fireball.
ML you got me thinking and you made me dizzy and I pooped my pants again.
Who disliked my comment? You can't argue with science. It's a constant, read a book.
Glen, they NEVER said WHERE she saw it! She easily could have seen it just before it landed in the water! MORON!
"Tee said that while she and her husband Marc Horn were sailing across the Indian Ocean from India to Thailand, she spotted what looked like a plane on fire during the night of March 7" Damn you're dumb. Scratch reading a book keith, might want to work on reading all together.
Ok, so let's go over your fire theory shall we. Based on last contact with the planes co-pilot at 17:22:00 the plane was "all clear" correct? Within minutes the fire was large enough that it was able to not only knock out the communication systems, but render the pilots, crew and passengers unconcious. Have you ever heard of the old saying where there's smoke there's fire? So not only did nobody notice that there was a fire before it was large enough to do damage to the vital systems, but the fire suppressant systems were not able to put out the fire. Yes, Boeing admited that they had a storage of Lithium-ion batteries that could quite possible start a large fire in no time flat, but Lithium batteries are also very explosive and self heating, which is why a Lithium battery fire is able to melt through steel. So, let's forget all of that, throw it out the window. This large fire (as it would have to have been in your theory) would DECREASE the time that it would take to explode. More fire equals more heat which equals, you guessed it, more energy. A large enough of a fire, that plane wouldn't have made it out of the Moracco Strait, let alone into the Indian Ocean. Hell a large enough fire that plane wouldn't have made it past "All clear".
I saw the same plane flying over Decatur Alabama.
And i saw Amelia Earhart crash and haven't said anything until now. Sound like she had too many liquid refreshments,among other things.
The time lapse here makes me think she might have been smoking some of those "funny cigarettes!" Definitely worth examining, however, after all the time and money already spent.
Why is this woman so ready to believe that she just happens to be going insane? I just don't quite understand why your immediate conclusion would be that you're going insane when what you saw, however unusual, is completely plausible. I'm not jumping to the conclusion that she actually is not quite sane just yet, no matter how easily willing she is to jump to that conclusion herself, but I'd definitely like to hear a little more from her on this before I decide anything. How long ago did the plane go down before she ever mentioned anything about it? I'm assuming they had news about it in Phuket too. Also, I could be wrong here, don't have her whole story from this article maybe, but it seems odd that she doesn't mention anything about the plane crashing into the ocean--if she saw it on flames from the boat, stands to reason she'd also witness it crashing into the ocean and that would be worth mentioning. Maybe there's more to her account, but if anything ever seemed iffy, this is it and especially this far removed from the disappearance of the plane.
I know people on certain medications or who suffer from certain ailments that might make them question themselves. Even some migraine sufferers can experience odd 'lights' in their vision. I don't know enough of her background to totally rule it out.
@Dan: Only a sane person questions their sanity. Her story is fishy as hell.
I don't know I once thought I saw a man jump off a very high bridge and right away I said to myself no way must have been my brain seeing things only to find out the next day that a man did indeed jump off the bridge.
Maybe one more piece of the puzzle. Maybe not. Check it out and see what happens. Don't be so damn negative.
She had been at sea for several days. Most sailors, myself included, get a little punch drunk at times when sailing on long passages. You're not sleeping well, you're seeing the same thing, endless ocean all the time, and the there are no lights to interfere with the stars, so you pretty much see endless meteors coming in, planets, planes, and satellites moving across the sky that you would never normally be able to see, many quite far off, and you do begin to not trust you eyes at times, or be one hundred per cent sure what is real and what you imagining. I don't know that "insane" is a good word to describe it, although it does technically meet the definition of "psychosis".
Good post Tom and exactly Richard.
Perhaps she had been drinking too much & doesn't want anyone to find out about the drinking. Better to be insane than a drunk woman!
@ lady-like. Everybody loves a drunk #$%$ woman....lol
Great post, Richard. Thank you for shedding some light on this story with real world experience. My thoughts were that she could be suffering from insomnia, she could have been fighting with her husband, emotional stress can make the mind do strange things. She doesn't strike me as just an attention seeker. Someone seeking attention would have spread their story far and wide at the first possible chance.
let's all say we were sailing in the ocean that night! lol Seriously though, hard to believe this story being told. If she saw the plane on fire in the sky, you think she would have known after about 4 seconds that it wasn't a meteorite. The average person would have been so curious and just followed it with their eyes to see what happened. My guess is if she did see something that night, it was a meteor. I've seen some in my day, and in the darkness of night in the middle of the ocean they look just as described. Huge fireballs, look elongated with a black plume. Sometimes they get so close, your mind will start playing tricks on you as to what you witnessed.
Out of all the comments I have been reading Richard, I think you are the only one who articulated it perfectly well - in such a way that it is logical even to people like us who are lay-men on such topics and also in science.
stuckaccelator, as much as women are the worst attention seekers in the world but I don't want to believe that they cant go to such extremes!!!!!! There is more to her story than mere attention seeking.
Hey, that's what me and Bubba seen when we was out snipe hunting. There was this big shiny thing, plus my initials are MH and I was born in March 1970- (370) - so I is sure we seen that air-e-o-plane fly straight over us, then go straight up into a spinning web that spread out from the moon Can I get free publicity now too?
that makes 2 people that saw the plane on fire in the sky. The oil rigger guy, working in the Indian ocean also documented the longitude and laditude of what he saw in the sky on fire. Honestly, I think the plane was shot down by mistake by the government and they are trying desperately to hid the location where it was shot down. If anyone out there is smart, look under water where these 2 eye witness say they saw the plane in the sky on fire. You just may find the plane.
Oil rigger never claimed to see the plane. Just a fiery object.
Is "pb" short for poo brain? Just curious.
It's a government cover-up! Pb, cancel your subscription to Netflix.
You're 100% right, Dennis. That was obvious from the beginning, but which government?
"that makes 2 people that saw the plane on fire in the sky. The oil rigger guy, working in the Indian ocean also documented the longitude and laditude of what he saw in the sky on fire. " Never mind the fact that they were no where near each other. ;)

Outer Space, Deep Ocean, Gateway to other Dimensions, Government Conspiracy Theories, Governments Lying, Lunatic Pilots, Terrorists or, WHATEVER ELSE.....bottom line is WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED so all hearsays, gossips and rumors are all worth the time to investigate, After all, more than 200 souls needs to be put to rest and their families to get closure on their fates and whereabouts.
And no thought to actually try and take a picture or video? How about radioing into the Coast Guard or whatever agency covers the waters out there? Did she happen to capture her own Lat/Long so we would have some idea where it happened? Seems like a lot of missing info here.
The original flight plan was through the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. Where is the flight plan through the Indian Ocean?
I suppose it's difficult to make up a believable excuse for not coming forward sooner.
Woman Claims She Saw Missing Malaysian Air Flight While Sailing In Indian Ocean - this headline should read "Woman Looking For Her Fifteen Minutes Of Fame" It's a little late for someone to claim they saw the plane before it crashed when they had plenty of time to speak up months earlier. Where the hell was she? On an island?
If anyone saw the picture she gave you will notice the aircraft has propellers and the wing is way too straight. I'd like to have the camera and lens she has to get a picture that good, that deep.
Next they'll speculate the plane encountered a wormhole and entered the Twilight Zone.
Another fiction straying the public away from the truth.
This is the second eye witness to step forward saying they saw what looked like a plane burning in the sky that night. I just find it strange that a plane on fire would fly that long. With the fuel and oxygen on board, most fires would consume a plane within half an hour
I'm thinking the entire thing would just explode!
Don't take things easy that woman so a burning plane with other planes moving around it let the government go to that point at the same time the woman so that thing then they will get a solution.
I saw Bin Laden at a buffet yesterday. He and Elvis were fighting over a shrimp plate.
Sounds like she is competent enough to have a job in politics.
It has always confused me when they said the plane turned around and went below radar altitude and then flew 1500 miles south towards Australia then dumped into the ocean. If the plan was to dump into the ocean why turn around and get below radar altitude to do something you could have done without all the trouble? If the plan was to ditch the plane in the ocean just go down on the way to China. NO this plane is in India or Pakistan and will be used for Taliban terrorism in the future.
As you said "IF" the plan was to crash it into the ocean. The key word being IF. You don't know what the plan was and are assuming you do just to reach the conclusion you want. It's also possible the plan was to crash it into a DEEP part of the ocean where it would difficult to find and recover evidence from.
She is full of it. Period.
Oh really, was it 420 time when this all took place.
Somebody saw something. It might have been her.
So, this tells me that Yahoo! News will perpetuate any unsubstantiated story. Maybe what she really saw was the UFO that abducted Elvis Presley, Glenn Miller and Amelia Ehrhardt. Climb back inside the bottle, Katherine, and pull the cork in behind you. And shame on Yahoo! for repeating this yarn.
I have a HAM radio and one of my secret informants advised me that the sailor didn't initially come forward because she had Jason Bourne on board and was trying to dig the micro locator out of his #$%$. My informant went on to say the two planes were actually scrambled F4s by the Uzbekistan Air Force, not with the plane as their target, but rather an attempt to hit the boat with the jetliner thereby making it look like a freak accident. I only come forward now because I missed last month’s Capitol One credit card payment and the bill collectors are calling during supper.
My first chuckle of the day, good play.
Hysterical...! Sad situation but, this was funny.
When I read that she didn't say anything for THREE F*ING MONTHS, I thought I was hallucinating.
Thank goodness she decided now OUT OF A CLEAR BLUE SKY to tell us this information! It isn't like the ENTIRE WORLD has paid any attention to this story! Yeah, I believe that she knows anything just like I believe the plane crashed anywhere except in a nice landing at a runway in Vietnam! Sorry, but the longer this goes the more likely this simply was a beautifully well-done robbery.
What a ridiculous story with a ridiculous photo attached. I am so amazed at the media that puts this &#!+ out. I guess I'm even more amazed by those that believe this drivel.
Where is the f,ing plane? Are you entertained by the loss of 230 plus lives? Jack #$%$.
And i am so amazed that you took the time to read this drivel and comment on it...
She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time. So after all the publicity about this plane she is just now realizing it might have been the plane. She is full of "S"hit and just wants he hour of glory
Another twisty tale of the missing Malaysian 777 MH370. One thing is certain, there's a gloomy conspiracy to the missing airliner.
She's a filthy liar looking for attention!
If the two additional airplanes were not seen, the burning airplane itself is already way off.
I believe plane was high jacked to an bunker somewhere on a piece of an island and being painted to look like Air Force One..so they can invade into US soil undetected.. We all can write a movie script on this one--the missing jet with no debris after days of searching with sophisticated equipment and satellites.. And all the while we just needed to find this sailer who saw the plane but did not tell anyone. I am sure her radio or some communication source was available to her to hear how many people were interested in any leads before the 30 day black box stops, Her story sounds as bizarre as mine.. I like the bunker idea and maybe I should get my 15 minutes of fame when I tell how I sound the ground open up and the plane went down. he he
Sorry AIR FORCE ONE has four engines that might make it hard to disguise
Sorry to punch holes in some of your processes of disproving her theory. 1. The animation was almost certainly not done by her. 2. the plane in the animation does not have propellors. 3. if a plane is burning in an advanced state, enough to make it glow in the way she describes, the flames would in fact make the smoke trailing very visible in the night sky. especially in the indian ocean. 4. sailing the indian ocean takes an enormous amount of time, when did she make anchor? 5. if in fact the reports are true, the cargo hold held large quantities of extremely flammable batteries, just forward of which, is the navigational compartment holding the transponder, radio's, navigation aids, etc.. they would have been the first to go. 6. the procedure of climbing to altitude as reported is consistent with an uncontrollable fire of unknown origin in order to starve oxygen. conversely, the cabin uses up oxygen ultimately requiring a rapid decent. if this was the case the crew would have been lost and eventually overcome by the fumes, the MH370 is inherently stable aircraft and may have flow on its own for a very long distance till eventually coming apart over a large area. 7. The large area those pieces would be spread across is mind bogglingly small compared to the enormity of the indian ocean. I myself hope she's right and can lead the search in a direction that will give the families involved closure. If it's a contrived story, Karma's a #$%$
Propellers? Hahahaha Since when do jets have propellers?
Well if you can explain how she saw smoke in the night sky, you might have a point. Unfortunately, she might have seen a flame - really unlikely at 30,000 feet - but there is no way in hell you can see a contrail at night - you know without light.
LOL Presstitutes are getting desperate. News , ANYTHING, as long as it doesn't concern Obama and they will post it.
There were many Chinese nationals on board. The only thing I can think of that makes sense is that somebody has a beef with China: stealing their islands, land, money, oil, etc. Too perfect to have been an accident.
She actually saw a UFO, govt agents are trying to convince her she saw a plane.
I don't know if I'd take seriously a person that thinks it's more likely that she's insane than that she saw a meteor.
I am under the impression that sailing requires a sailboat...
The story doesn't mention that she could see the pilot and copilot and that they were leprechauns.
Why would it fly umpteen hours off course and then catch fire right as it runs out of fuel? She could hallucinate something more plausible.
I have suspected all along that this plane was hijacked. It was then flown by the pilot to over 40000 ft, which suffocated everyone on board, except for the ones responsible, who were wearing masks. During 911, as well as other plane crashes. There have been at least 1 text, or telephone call from a plane in trouble. In this flight, not one message. Something happened to these people quickly and suddenly. If the plane was flying on fire, a telephone call would have been made by someone, explaining their dire situation. This is why I am certain, the pilot disabled their air bags, flew to higher elevation suffocating them.
I seriously doubt there is a "Disable Air Masks" button on the control panels. It is an automated system that has a manual deploy feature but cannot be disabled.
Wow, so many Sherlocks and so few Watsons.
I believe that plane is on the ground somewhere, probably in Iran or Turkey??
Why depict a boat that's obviously a powerboat when your story specifically said she was sailing?
And waits how many months to tell her story. Sounds very suspicious
Bigfoot was piloting the plane she saw.
If I saw something that strange and I couldn't believe my eyes, I would have taken pictures to back it up. What, she didn't have a phone, camera, or anything to record it with?
In the middle of the indian ocean in a small boat, yeah that could tend to make you insane and see things that really aren't present.
Yup, another voice from the wilderness, CNN must be beside themselves, another phony sighting. CNN used to be a news station, now it is a gossip tell another rendition of the imagination. If you like to hear about aliens to bibs that go beep in the dark, tune to CNN. Ping ... pong at its best.
Let me ask something here that hasn't been addressed yet. Where was David Copperfield on March 7th? I think that...that's the way this investigation needs to go.
Why would you randomly think you were hallucinating? Unless you had a reason to be hallucinating?
It's very disconcerting that The CIA has tracked flight paths of all airlines and has Revealed several times flight paths of missing airplanes but no info on this incident.This flight had certain national security implements aboard perhaps some equipment to avoid radar detection.
The last time I saw a plane catch fire and go down (no kidding!), I most definitely did NOT feel insane. It was more like a severe adrenalin rush, if anything.
This was at the exact same time Putti was taking over Crimea. My first thought was, when the plane disappeared, this plane was purposely downed quietly and suspiciously to take half of the media interest away from Russia's aggression. It worked. If you check the timing, early March was when official Russian troops (not the special forces that had been there a month already with no identification yet speaking Russian) started military operations literally a few days before; and Russia was getting worldwide condemnation for it. I guess I'm surprised there wasn't another unexplainable international incident within a week or two later; Flight 370 did take a lot of the center stage for a long time. A missing jet in the ocean, can't find it, it's soooo deep in that area. Don't worry, Putti was already sanctioned for hell; it's just a matter of how much of a suck-up to Luci he can be before someone over there gets the balls to deliver him.
I've heard other opinions as well concerning Putin as a possible link to this mystery.
The reason there is so much mystery is because of WHO and WHAT was on-board that plane! Checkout the name of the company that lost over 25 employees on that flight. Look into what that company makes and the patents that were approved just days before the flight. Also look at WHO profits from these patents. It will all fit together!
Peter, If you had the info, Why the tease? Facts and Sources please
Very interesting. I looked it up on Wikipedia found everything excepts who profits from the patents.
I was sitting on my back porch, minding my own business, with a major buzz and thought I saw Elvis. I did not see that plane or bigfoot as bigfoot had left the day before for Fort Lauderdale on vacation. He was last seen wearing a speedo lounging with a couple of New York women who were trolling for trouser trout and had taken a fancy for him.
I believe that this plane will be used in the next major terrorist attack. As for the hostages they were either killed our placed in some sort of hiding camp . If the plane was shot down or crashed I think that some debris would have been found. There seems to be something very fishy regarding this. Perhaps the Government is covering the truth up. Regardless everything that is on the table is hypothetical. Only time will tell. However a plane loaded with high explosives or even a nuclear bomb could easily fly into safe air space to make an attack without it being shot down. There is know way the USA is going to shot down a UFO with out identifying it first. There are numerous UFOs that fly into our airspace that go unreported.
A sailor that lacks confidence? I believe more in a need for attention.
its too hard to believe that MH370 is still missing up to now.There's something fishy here how can the government and all other authorities and satellites fail to trace the plane and the people in it??. I suspect MH370 was hijacked. Sarah don't get guilty because you are innocent and no one will blame you.thanks for the information
Oh no excuse me. She saw Harry Potter flying on a flaming Nimbus 2000. I heard those Nimbus' can really burn a trail.
This woman sounds like a NUT. It's so easy after the fact to say you have seen something and get your 15 minutes of fame when in reality she probably had one too many martini's that night.
Well I don't know what type of gear current fighter jets have but if they wanted to I imagine they could jam radio waves and force another plane into a direction change and then kill everyone with one of their weapons. So that's a scary thought. Who would do such a thing? If those were regular civilian planes, private business planes or any other type they would have reported it.
Dude you smoking some of those same things as Ms Tee.
Actually you are right there is technology available to jam other jets and you can literally shut down all electronics and electrical components. I worked with this jets before in the NAVY. They called them EA-6B Prowlers, I served in a squadron VAQ- 137 ROOKS (Electronic attack warfare). Currently EA-6B is being replaced by a better plane and more advanced jamming technology (F -18 Grawler)
Thanks Yury, that was very courteous of you to provide such useful information in a reply. Also thank you for serving.
Obviously the best course of action when watching a burning plane crash in the ocean is to wait a couple months before reporting it. After all, burning planes fall out of the sky all the time, it's nothing to get all bent out of shape about.
Hang on everybody. I actually boarded this plane and got off mid air after realizing it was doomed.
Some folk would say and do anything to get on the telly.
somebody alert CNN! They can return this to the headline story for at least 3 weeks...
CNN is only concerned when "racist" comments make a story. Right now Justin Beiber and Donald Sterling are the story. I think FOX finally convinced them that the Bergdahl fiasco might be worth a look.
Like FOX has made Obamacare it's headline for 6 years now?
I like the CNN coverage about the plane, this is a mystery and seriously we should keep looking for this plane, if my family members were on this plane I would NEVER give up!
A comment coming from someone named oj bin zimmerman is COMPLETELY USELESS. GROW UP! And there OJ at least Fox reports the news! Would you trade ONE deserter for 5 top Taliban?
ojbz, your name says it all.
BREAKING NEWS on CNN...The plane that was missing, yea, it's still missing. Here is our correspondent with the latest information. "Wolf, the plane is still missing"...That's right folks, you heard it here first!
@ojbz, Obamacare DESERVES to be an ongoing headline. Sooner or later you will come to realize this.
Yep, BREAKING NEWS! 24/7. Good post.
[Nancy Grace] Wheres the justice[/Nancy Grace]
Sorry, The soldier returning home will be topic for the next 2 months
A CNN reporter took a picture with the would be missing pilot a week before the 'story broke'. interesting, it is.
Like Benghazi, IRS,NSA spying and Obamacare should not be headline news for everybody that doesn't kiss Obama B()tt..
Alien abduction is still a possibility.....BWAHAHAHA!
If I had a dollar for every time CNN had "Breaking News" and then told us something we already knew Bill Gates would have a new neighbor with a bigger house.
Amazing critics, almost 300 people dead and CNN shouldn't cover it. Maybe if you were on board, no one would care either. Nitwit
OJBZ...sorry, but hijacking one-sixth of the US economy under the guise of "health care" is news worth reporting..
Theyd like to, it would save them the trouble of coming up with excuses for their beloved idiot president, Obama
@ Betty, did you serve in the military? did your children or other relations serve? at least he served. How about all you people that fled to Canada instead of joining the military during the Vietnam era. Israel, the most security and military minded country on earth does it all the time They swap hostages all the time. Are you taking the perhaps, paid and arrainged army buddy of his by republicans who are saying bad things about him to be the truth because FOX said so? We all know the type of truth that comes out of FOX. Don't we? Why don't you republicans that always looking for scandals where none exists give the guy a chance? The army already said it will or have started investigation. Nothing ever satisfies NeoCon teabaggers when it comes to Obama. Didn't Dubya, release hundreds, years back? i did not hear you repubs criticize him. Only a handful of all these congressmen and women have ever put on the uniform, nor their children. All the war mongering hawks, all of them defered military drafts a million times each. Their motto, or slogan is send them out to war to die or get crippled and when they come back, you tell them it is too expnsive to give them care and benefit due them. Yeah, govt. is too big. But it is never too big to get increases in their already bloated salaries which they earn in Washington at the expense of tax payers for doing nothing, for doing didly-squatt. You go digest this and come back to me. Betty
@Festus...since when are the 5 that were let go called "hostages". We never made demands to give them their freedom. Obama illegally traded them for 1 of ours. Our guy was the hostage...the 5 terrorists were getting 3 "special" meals a day, prayer and prayer rugs. What about the christian pastor being held in Iran or the new mother that is going to be put to death because she married a Christian?.........my daughter is in the Army and I am proud of her. I know that she wouldn't want to be traded for terrorists.
@Jimmy D,,,,naa,,Nancy grace wouldn't say "Where's the justice" she say ,,how about 2 more plate's of food,I'm still hungry.
@Albert...They covered it. Then they kept telling us the same things over and over again under the guise of Breaking News. They pretended for over a month that nothing else in the world was happening neglecting to cover anything else.
can you hear the pings? CAN YOU HEAR THEM NOW!!!!
No, CNN has proof that the plane went through a worm hole, is back in time, and one day we will uncover it among fossil evidence that they battled dinosaurs. They had a psychic on who confirmed it. That's it, the consensus is in, and it's settled science.
I'm surprised nobody had asked this yet, but what the heck was she doing in the middle of the ocean in the middle of nowhere?
Wow Betty is one of those "informed" people who actually believes that Faux News is real news.
Betty do you think that Stephen Colbert is a republican?
LET US GET ISSA AND FORM A COMMITTEE. WE COULD CALL IT THE ISSA MIKE NIGHT
I had to watch the plane story in a Dr. office on Fox news when it first happened. I had to wait forever and they spent what seemed like an hour theorizing and relating it to completely unrelated stuff. They don't even pretend to be news, they just sat around theorizing. It should be renamed The Conspiracy Theory news channel.
Fox is already all over it, they will be covering it 24/7 starting tomorrow at 6am After they are done we can check with a REAL Network for the Correct info
CNN with ANDERSO COOPER IS THE BEST PERIOD..
Last Firday at 10 pm EST, CNN had 35,000 viewers. I can't see them lasting much longer.
Why is the media even entertaining this crazy lady?
I blame yahoo for allowing a sick stories like this,what a waste of time.
While I understand the need of the families to have closure, it is time to put this to rest. At this point, there would be very little to recover.
She probably saw the Virgin Mary on a slice of toast that morning, too.
Did she? I dunno. Is it at least possible? Certainly. This is one of those situations where nothing would surprise me (except aliens - that would surprise me - although, incredibly enough I've heard that theory too). Having been out on a boat in deep water I find nothing at all incredible about what she thinks she saw. Of course, having been out on a boat in deep water I also know that it is very, very easy to lose an accurate sense of proportion. With that said, her opinion is every bit as worth looking into as any of the other opinions the authorities have paid attention to.
Had to laugh at your comment since a few "news" sources did indeed blame alien abduction.
Hey Sharkoor I drew a picture of mohammed. ((.))
I flushed someting that looked like mohammed.
excuse me but, we aliens, have nothing to do with this event. you are making me lafe! oh btw, the pilot wants his wife to know he is ok, can you pass that on?
Katherine Tee? Are you serious? This woman would say anything to get her 15 minutes.
LMAO...What a world of difference!!! If something like that had happened in the US, every #$%$ would have been on TV describing it. However, I'm sorry that I don't actually believe this story because it just seems odd that they saw something like that and didn't say anything for fear they would be thought 'insane'.
I saw a waterspout while deep sea fishing one time.
Governments have spent gazillions and many weeks searching for the plane and have come up empty. A vacationing woman comes forward and solves it. The world would be better served if all governments would be replaced by anything, including vacationing women.
I guess, it is nice to see your name in print, even with the most idiotic story imaginable! Well, there will be MORE soon!
I'm still convinced that this is a real life make up of the show Lost. The same exact thing happened in the show. These people will be time traveling and experiencing some crazy stuff for the next few years and then in the end they will all just randomly show up and find out the whole thing was just a dream.
My neighbor thought she saw pieces of missing flight MH370 in her bathtub. The water drained out too fast to confirm the sighting. The search for the missing flight still continues
Am I the only one to notice that sailboat is missing a sail? Spot on recreation.
She was with Austin Powers getting shagged by GoldMember while she saw the flaming trail. Sean Connery was there too watching for fun.
If what she is saying is true, she just added to the families grief, not help them find closure. What she is describing sounds more like a "conspiracy", than a mere accident! I'm going to say that this woman is crazy and just looking some attention. Even if u thought ur eyes deceived u, this story of a missing plane, was in such heavy rotation, she should have known her eyes did not deceive her. Also, who the hell looks up flight plans? I'm a regular person, i wouldn't know how to look up a flight plan if my life depended on it. So, either this woman is crazy, or she is involved in this somehow, and her conscience is making her come forward, but she is trying to do it in such a way, that she does not end up going to jail. If we here that she commits suicide, then we know that she knew something for real, and they killed her to silence her!
Maybe she is right she's off her medications. And she is crazy
I was on a motorcycle trip and after rounding a bend on a highway I thought I saw a big abandoned building on the south side of the highway. I could of sworn it was about 125 miles from home. I didn't stop to investigate it but I know I saw it when I passed it. On the way back several days later I looked for it and it wasn't there..Checked google earth but have never found it. When you're tired you see things..and I believe her. If she was tired and manning the helm she could have thought she saw things before..it happens when you are exhausted.
@Mistoh, Shoot, I can't find things in my own home even when I'm positive it was right THERE. I always find it days later somewhere else. lol But I'm with you on the lost building thingy. When I would go to see my sister in the next town I would pass an old dilapidated half collapsed house sitting about 100 yards off from the road. For years I had seen that house and then one day I didn't. I checked again on the way home and it still wasn't I where I thought it should be. One day I mentioned to my sis about that house being torn down. She didn't know about the house and had never seen it on her trips over to see me. It has puzzled me for years. Maybe she just pays better attention to the road than I do. I know it's easy to miss things off to the side when you're driving. I missed a whole herd of buffalo in a field one time. My nephew driving right ahead of me in his pu asked if I saw them. I thought he was pulling my leg at first but we both turned around and drove back and there they were. haha
Not what one might normally call a yacht, but I am neverrtheless interested that they undertook such a voyage in such a modest boat, if the graphic is accurate.
And it's a search that may well prove fruitless. I suspect for a number of reasons that the plane wil never be found- and we are long past the point now where it would be possible to get a signal from the black boxes, even assuming they survived the crash if there was in fact one. The batteries are long since exhausted by now. Without them, the only hope the searchers have is if someone by chance saw something that can actually be verified. It doesn't sound like this woman did, though.
It will eventually be found, in a year, 10 or 100. All kinds of long lost things have been found. All of them without transponders.
The Titanic's batteries were dead also and it was found. Yes it was larger, but today's technology is better as well.
These news 'stories' are just that, stories. The lady in this amazing story was able to see black smoke coming from the plane at night??
smaller search grid for the titanic
Rt.... if it was a moonlit night at sea she probably could see a smoke trail. The sky is so clear over the oceans it is amazing to be out there on a clear night.
Agreed starlight , and considering that the Indian ocean is vast and overwhelmingly deep , 5 , 6 even 8 miles deep in some areas and with the fact that a plane will break into multiple pieces and scatter in the current of the water , that plane may never be found .
I was on a cable laying ship that came across a desk and chair in 3000 feet of water while doing ROV work. Bet whoever threw them over never expected anyone to see them again.
DanialB.. The position of the Titanic was known the day it sank. To find it required searching only a couple square miles of ocean. Even best guesses would require searching 10,000's of square miles for this plane.
Daniel, rescue ships came to the site where the Titanic sank. The ship also sent out distress signals before it went down. Dead batteries?
The main point, I think, is that this plane would have busted apart on impact leaving multiple floating debris. How come no one has found any remnants of the planes 'stuff'
Learn how to spell Albert. It's spelled plane.
But, what if she did see the plane? If she thought no one would believe her, it looks like she's right. Even I don't believe her, but what if she did see it?
@ DanielB, they already had a good idea where the Titanic was before they started looking for it.
sorry charlie..they have passive pinging too
Passive pinging from what, Johnny? Not from the battery powered recorders, they don't. Pinging doesn't just occur spontaneously- something has to cause it.
First, the video accompanying this article, shows a motor launch which would be incapable of traveling the distance claimed. They no doubt had a sail boat. If Ms.Tee were any kind of sailor, she would have recorded her position on her GPS, or if she is an old fashioned girl, a sextant. That information would have been extremely helpful in the search. That she didn't do it makes me question her veracity. By the way, I also have done some sailing -- thirty-five years worth.
Well, in her defense, she did say that she was hallucinating. Maybe some good drugs???.
A sextant you say..do you want to buy mine....I retired from the sea in 1992...even then no fellow deck officer even remembered how to use one....I always took a sight once a day even if it was just LAN...Peoples watch videos and Videos...Very few know the realitys of life at sea...very few....been there and don that...Live at sea is damn dangerous...some righ girl with a speedboat knows nothing whatsoever about the sea or what surrounds her...Too bad a great white did not show up...that would have changed her entire perspective....
I wouldn't put too much stock in the animation, but you're right about logging her position. It should be easy enough to backtrack if we know the TOD, time she saw it, her speed and heading, using simple algebra.
Dennis - how much? Back in the day (USN), we only had dead-reckoning + celestial + chronometer + LORAN (flaky in distant oceans) to fix our positions at sea. The Master Chief QM would test the junior watch officers' celestial nav skills from time to time, just to let them know who knew what when things got cloudy, the deck was rolling and it was raining - and to keep them in their place. :)
Why does she need to tell you these things? Perhaps she has those co-ordinates, but again, why does she need to tell us that.
We do not know , as to how much info she or they have supplied as of now.
They keep saying a sail boat and the photos don't look like a sail boat to me.......
How about a Long. Lat. ? All this does is fuel needless speculation. The Business Insider article, from which this one is paraphrased, only says she reported it to the "proper authorities". Who? I'm about ready to join the conspiracy crowd with all the evasions and half-arsed reporting going on by the authorities. I'm put in mind of previous incidents that involved highly embarrassing losses at sea whose reports of detection were covered up for months by authorities while they concocted plausible explanations that were less embarrassing. More frustrating, from that same article from BI, they now say "Authorities in Australia said last week they has [sic] found no wreckage in a targeted zone — based on sounds believed to have been from the plane’s black box locator beacon —" However, at the time they said they had, on one pass, heard up to 2 continuous minutes of 33.5 kHz tonal pings, occurring once every 1.1 seconds (the black box pinger makes a nominal 37.5 kHz ping, once each second - the discrepancy could have been from the dying battery, said the CEO of Ducane, the maker of the pinger). But, where is the raw data recording of that 2 minutes? That sound had to be coming from a commercial pinger - not a natural sound in the ocean, and the recording device was below the surface in quiet water some distance behind the towing vessel. If the authorities went on a wild goose chase without having the raw data (taking the word-of-mouth of a operator listening to a live feed), and having that data scrutinized by an independent expert, they ought to be replaced. I'm not asking for anything exceptional as this is de rigueur in u/w acoustics analysis.
Sound under water can carry for EXTREMELY long distances due to thermal layers. Those pings could have been from hundreds of miles away. Let's remember, it took over 2 years to find the Air France black box in the Atlantic a couple years ago and they knew pretty much where it was.
No Michael - Acoustic pressure-waves of high source amplitude/power and low frequency may do what you say under the right conditions, but the output power of the relatively tiny Ducane pinger is nowhere near the output power of ship/sub sonars, or the output of great whales, and its frequency is much higher than either - i .e., it doesn't carry nearly as far. That said, there are published depth/detection-radius specs for the Ducane pinger in question, but those are for detection "at the surface". As "the surface" usually contains a lot of white noise from wind and breaking wave action, those specs must be taken as average. However, these guys were, as I alluded to, towing a more sophisticated hydrophone at some depth (away from the surface and probably "looking down" so as to ignore the surface noise) some distance behind the ship - a relatively ideal (v. average surface) measurement. So, they may well have been able to pick up the signal a considerable distance further away than the average specs would predict - but not 100s of miles. Additionally, the first thing they should have done was measure the sound-velocity profile of the entire water-column from surface to bottom (salinity, temp at various depths - that doesn't require highly sophisticated equipment - with the assumption that in open ocean, the profile obtained would be fairly similar in nearby areas. That would give them a fair idea of how much ducting might have been going on. Also, the Air France jet went down in an area of very complicated underwater terrain - much more so than in this part of the Indian Ocean. In any case, all that doesn't change what I said about the raw data and its interpretation.
Wildman you are WRONG!!! When I rode the U.S.S. Florida we could hear sounds THOUSANDS of miles away (or farther!) with PASSIVE sonar!!! It depends on what layer of the ocean you are listening to and HOW the sound got there (it's exact path).
What frequency, Keith? And, what were the sounds you heard?
Well, unless the Florida somehow managed to suspend laws of physics, Keith, it didn't happen that an omnidirectional, high-frequency (37 kHz), weak source amplitude signal, emanating from the abyssal plain (or anywhere else in the water column) was heard thousands of miles away - and the laws of physics aren't classified. Review transmission and propagation loss as functions of spreading, and absorption (the attenuation coefficient) as a function of frequency. The latter alone puts absorption loss, at 35kHz, well over 2dB per km ( 32 dB loss every 10 miles), without even considering spreading. The signal would be buried in ambient ocean noise in relatively short order, regardless of ducting conditions in the deep ocean.
Wildman I DID NOT say we heard THAT SIGNAL, just signals, not specific ones! You can't read and comprehend that! You are a fool who does NOT even understand basic english enough to respond correctly to basic statements! IDIOT!
Keith, you are a little boy who's never grown up, and at your age you never will. It's too bad someone didn't kick your #$%$ properly when you were in your formative years.
Claims after claims ! No confirmations, no proofs, no results.
Too late lady, CNN used up everybody's 15 minutes.
Amen and Amen . That is what I was looking for..................
if you got legs ,you can try fox !
Right Ms Tee, anything to get yourself on the news.
The jet landed right next to the boat carrying Elvis.
Obviously had too much to drink.
So lemme get this straight, months after a random lady comes out and says she thinks she saw a gigantic plane on fire followed by 2 other planes and says it's probably her hallucinations? Are you kidding me? Let's just say she did think it was hallucination. Fine. Why come forth now? And second, how does a burning plane NOT leave any type of presence of debris or black box? Or even detection of other planes.
Well, I try to believe all she said. But the NOISE about the accident JUST in that area, give us an idea of his England condition. Hell, and her husband? Was he sleeping?
It sounds like she realized she could get 15 minutes of fame by telling this story after all that time went by. Folks love conspiracy theories. The 2 other planes she saw shot down the airliner? They were sent to intercept because of no communication with it and watched it go down in flames without telling anyone about it? Either too many beers/drugs or they were on a drug run at the time.
So you spor the most widely searched plane in the world and it has smoke coming from it and you don't even inspect yourself? She is full of #$%$. No one who saw the plane would leave until rescue arrived or at least a verification that the 2 so called planes above it reported it. Why did they even report this? The families must really see closure in the fact you could have saved some of them. Idiot
So she has confidence to sail out in the Indian ocean for days but no confidence to report a plane on fire?
I wouldn't be sailing if I was mentally unstable
So she thought it was either a meteorite, a plane with orange lights and black smoke, or a plane on fire. Yes, she sounds very credible...
Simple! If she recorded the lat/long of her sail boat at the time, a quick under seas search of the area can be made. Heck, they have already wasted two months searching the wrong area.
So, what is an elongated plane? It was dark, but she saw black smoke. This is the verbal equivalent of hiding in plane (had to put a pun in there) sight!!! Because she said she thought she was going insane makes her sane to be able to recount this claim so we think naturally she isn't insane. I've got news for you but you can read about it later when every news org in the world drags this one out for the next 120 days.
Glad to know you have this one under control. Pun intended.
You can see black smoke at night, especially if the moon is out there and it does no need to be a fool moon either.
Elongated? Maybe she's stretching the truth.
Maybe she was tripping on pot or something else and thought what she was seeing was part of the trip. That might make her feel somewhat ashamed. Or maybe she's had episodes before and thought this was another one. It could be anything; people's reactions are really unpredictable, not necessarily crazy, cavalier or stupid.
You know, I thinl i remeber seeing tthe missing plane also. I was doing something out on the ocean in early March and there it was. I only remember now because I realize there is money to be made. Right off hand I cannot recall if it was on fire or if Slim Pickins was riding it down to earth, but I can get all that squared away as soon as the interviewers start writing checks.
Another attention grabbing witch wanted 5min fame.
Hmm. yeah sure, then the Loch ness monster jumped out of the water, yes, the Loch ness monster in the Indian ocean and tried to grab the plane, Godzilla then came out of nowhere and a monster fight ensued, the plane was able to keep flight when the fight started and then disappeared on the horizon, never to be seen again. Yes, I would also take three months to report a plane on fire.
How does her location correlate to where they were searching off Australia?
More nonsense. How about some pictures of a sight like this. Also, there were several people claiming to be the lone survivors of the Gen. Custer massacre.
Me and Elvis were sitting out on the deck and thought we saw the plane overhead, but it ended up being the bug light.
Almost three months later, knowing all the families concerned about loved one aboard the jetliner and they're now coming forward! All the media coverage, newsprint and strange disappearance. A long time to think she was hallucinating. I'm sorry, but I tend to be one of those to dismiss he story.
The 'flight plan' didn't take the airplane over the Indian Ocean.
Another story complete with worthless primitive CGI reenactment. Fortunately the still with play cursor looks so completely hokey, not even a sailboat, I scoffed and didn't even consider clicking on it. When are they going to abandon this stupid trend?
OK..so she saw a plane on fire and 2 other planes flying near it yet not one of the pilots from the other planes reported anything and this woman waited months before reporting what she thinks she saw. Seriously? I don't think we will ever know what happened or find the aircraft. At least not in my lifetime. It' a horrific tragedy for all on board and their families.
What I want to know is how I can get paid for making these stupid animations that are becoming more common?
You know what, at this point, what other leads do we have? Might as well check it out if she can point them in the plane's direction.
This is a post I wrote a few days ago, one I received a few insults for. Sadly we may never know. However the stupidity and incompetence of every nation involved is simply unbelievable. For a nation like America who spies on everything to say that they don't know is ludicrous. I know many people believe what the governments say, but this is way beyond credible, for them not to know where this plane is is simply a lie of global ramifications. I have a feeling that those 2 guys with fake passports took over the plane, US scrambled a couple of fighters and shot it down, while everyone was told to look like an idiot, someone was recovering and covering and destroying all evidence. Just look stupid and confused, latter come back and pay the families millions to silence them and call everyone on board heroes and make then a memorial.
As I was walking my dog on the desert I saw that plane, it was glowing and moving slow and there was another object directly above it with a beam drawing it up. I could see little humanoids in the windows of the triangular object above the aircraft It was like slow motion, then I was suddenly in another place miles away and my dog was gone and I was far away from my home.I realized I was in kansas but I live in Arizona.
How do you lost your dog? poor dog! I cant believe you didn't look for your dog!
this is the funniest post I have seen in a long time ron. prosper
If there were any truth to this it would have been investigated concluding with some form of explanation. Instead all we see is a woman claiming she saw something that suggests an attack and conspiracy. If you saw what she claims and no one paid attention would you go public when you had nothing to go by except a very vague memory? She even loosely says she "was going insane." You would keep it to your close circle of family, friends and associates at the most. You own integrity would be on the line. This story does not add up.
Seeing a plane on fire would never be a "vague memory," no matter how much time passed. This story has "Wack job looking for, and getting, her 15 minutes of fame." We shouldn't even be talking about this, because we never should have heard about it.
And neither does your opinion of the story. She has just come forth and it's highly probable her story will be investigated after someone in a position of authority questions her thoroughly. If, the sailboat she was on had GPS, then it won't be hard to to pinpoint exactly where the boat was the night the plane crashed. Evidence like that will be the proof she is telling the truth or telling a huge lie. Hopefully, this woman is telling the truth and her information will help locate the downed plane.
What gave me "pause" was when she repeatedly said she couldn't believe her eyes, or that she was going "insane". Now I would certainly like to speculate that by now, she would have seen many eye popping things on a voyage in at night in the middle of the ocean (look what all happened in "Life of Pi".....That all being said, I saw a phenomenon happen several years ago: a meteorite that blazed the night sky ...a gigantic thing...it was over in 2 seconds...I will never forget it...if I hadn't been laying on the back of my truck watching the night sky, I would never have seen it...
Wait a minute. Are you saying that her disbelief isn't credible because she hadn't seen anything as interesting as what happens in Life of Pi, a fantasy novel?
LOL, I'll leave it to someone else to burst your bubble that the life of pi was fantasy movie.
and you saw a flying saucer!!.. cheers!!..
What, Life of Pi wasn't real!?! Damn.
What is crazier than this women...is Yahoo picking up the story and reporting it. REALLY, NOW YOU ARE COMING FORWARD AFTER 3 MONTHS. This women is another loser nut case looking for their 15 minutes of attention.
Don't blame Yahoo. This woman finally has come forward after 3 months.
If true, it's unlikely that the other planes she saw were military. I don't think that military jets on mission have their traffic control lights flashing.
I believe that anyone who saw a plane on fire in the sky would have alerted whatever authorities were available by phone or radio immediately. I work in law enforcement and people call 911 when someone farts too loud, and would especially for any fire in the sky. Boaters have contact with emergency agencies at all times. However I believe this woman saw the plane and the planes responsible for its loss because she was relying on the other planes to call for help and that is why she didn't contact anyone at that point. Now identify those planes and find out why they didn't call it in.
I read once where a lady called 911 cuz she was treated rudely at a Burger King drive thru.
Here we go. Last March this lady and her husband saw Flight 370 and are reporting it now. They didn't report it then because they couldn't believe it. Now, three months later they all of a sudden believe it. They are sorry they didn't act sooner. Well on their behalf I think I saw the plane too. From my apartment terrace. I wasn't sure so I didn't say anything. After I thought about it for a couple months I figured I better mention it.
YEA,you had another drink to HUH.
Either Tee alerted someone or she let it go doesnt change the fact that the souls are lost.
it's clear that the MH370 pilot/s deliberately brought the plane straying off the original path, then was challenged by airforce planes stationed in Diego Garcia. When no response was given by the pilot/s, strafed at the tail, and then escorted down to Diego Garcia, where up to now it's being investigated. :p
I also saw it while driving across the New Mexico desert.
Katherine Tee is bat$hit crazy. She "thought she was hallucinating", and "maybe I should have more confidence in myself"? It took her this long to put two and two together? Her story has BS written all over it.
This also correlates with what that oil rig worker saw (but I have to wonder if he was discredited yet or not?) If this is true, it sounds like the plane was on fire from the inside (due to... Batteries, oxygen, terrorism, an accident, etc.) It is interesting to say the least? I can't recall if the woman that spotted this plane or aircraft actually saw it go down or not or what direction she last saw it flying. I also suspect if military or other craft shot it down it could be for various reasons we may not know about... Such as a deadly virus on board, someone (maybe more then one person) that was wanted dead, and again, terrorism, an accident, aircraft malfunction, cell phone fire from an overheated battery, battery fire from another source, oxygen fire, etc. we may never know the whole truth but I do hope they discover the location of MH 370 in the next decade (and maybe other wrecks too, both ship and aircraft).
Where was the oil rig worker, and where was the woman, and at what times did they see this plane? That info would either support both or clearly discredit one of their stories. Of course, waiting three months means she could have tailored her story to match the oil rig workers, as that has been out for a while.
The most logical reason for not being able to find the wreckage is the plane didn't crash.
Most logical is that it was shot down and the act is being covered up. Some very wise people came out within a few days of the event and said that they believed it my never be found. So far so right...
the plane was shot down. 2 eyewitnesses saw it on fire in the air. 1 documented same sightings to his superior while working on the oil rig.
When people see something strange, don't they usually investigate it? Especially with the internet readily available? (even if she took a while to get home?!) I was standing outside in the evening a few years back, probably just after sunset. Looked up to see two very bright stars about a foot away from each other (based on my position.. far far away), flying through the sky, one directly behind the other. I have spent many nights satellite watching, but TWO of them, one following the other? Plus, these were brighter and easier to spot. You couldn't miss them. VERY strange. Went to the net the next morning and typed what I saw. Turned out, it was the Space Shuttle trailing the ISS after un-docking from it. They may have been following for hours, or days, but it was awesome to see that, and knowing I'll never see that again.
So you think the powers that be would let her testimony be made known in light of hush hush? They know where it went down, they have something to hid on China's side the attack on a air bus and the CIA'S use of a cvilian air bus to spy with, hmm
So power, there was a shuttle launch that evening, and every light seen is a shuttle launch, hmm
Get off my thread... you make no sense.
I think looking up something unusual you saw is a good idea (if you're curious about it) and possibly that's common, but calling up some authority to tell them (& convince them) that you saw something they need to know is an unlikely thing for most people to do. I don't think I would- I'd be afraid they'd laugh me off, not believe me, or put me on the cover of the Enquirer next to an alien story. Seriously though, I don't think most people call the authorities when they see unusual planes/lights/fireball things in the sky, like this woman, they just figure it was a plane or odd light illusion or they don't know quite what they saw & assume someone else more credible knows about it or will report it.
I understand mama... But if you find out they can't find a plane... I might want to make a report, even if anonymously. But who knows what I would do, as I was not in her situation.
yes, I have seen the satellites passing by ,like tiny stars moving at the same hour same place..
Bellota: the space station changes flight path every time it comes around, the time also changes every orbit,. no worries. try this (nasa.gov. find the station, will lead you to the exact time and place it will appier. just watched tonight wow 6-min.
I used to have an Android app that showed what was available at any given moment. It was nice. But, I must admit... finding it on your own is kind of a fun challenge. Especially if you are challenging someone to find more than you on any given night!
Let's not forget what led to Steve Fossett's body being left in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in 2007 for a year before it was found. He and his aircraft disappeared 6 hours after he took off on a pleasure flight into the mountains. As the search was going on, an "eyewitness" said he saw Fossett's plane in an area where searchers were not looking, so they abandoned the area where they calculated Fossett's plane would likely be and searched the area where the "eyewitness" said he saw the aircraft. When they didn't find it where the "eyewitness" said he saw it, they abandoned the search. A year later, a hiker found Fossett's wallet and other personal items in the area where the original search was being conducted but was abandoned because of the "eyewitness", and they quickly found the plane.
Smells fishy to me. I just hope that this isn't some sick minded individual that is trying to get attention. The families have suffered enough.
oh and by the way, there's a Yeti living in the woods behind my house. didn't want to mention at first so as not to alarm people, but I've been having these disturbing fantasies ...
I think some village is looking for their idiot?
2 months later and she speaks up? Attention hound? If not then someone should plot her location and project a course from where she was at for the planes final crash point.
I heard a guy say he saw it land somewhere in Arizona at a abandoned airbase. Yea I saw mickey mouse in a superman suit land in battery park.
Bet it was a Sat. I say this as I once saw a Soviet Sat come down on a evening stroll and at first thought it was a plane on fire. I saw orange fire and trailing smoke. It was much slower then you would think. Was getting real upset till it occurred to me that it was taking to long to crash. Next day paper said the police got lots of calls about a plane on fire,. but it was a satellite.
It was going about 17,000 mph. If it was going slow to your perspective it was heading right at you.
It was heading right to left. It went clear across the sky. When I say "slower then you would think" I mean that it was not like a shooting star but more like a fast plane. It was tumbling so it was going slower then 17k. I would say it took about 2 minutes. Live in Texas and it crashed in the Western Pacific. Saw the shuttle come in once and it was faster then the crashing satellite. Shrug. kinda hope I am wrong. New clues would be good.
Saw the same off the south coast of P.R.,of course I had no idea what it was but it came out it was a piece of a soviet sat,
sooo.... are you saying that MH370 was really a Russian satellite?
I saw the samething one day that I was camping in the woods. You'll be surprised the things you'll see when you camp in the woods. It also had the russian symbol and said cccp, traveling at around 15,000MPH
I saw a dancing bear in the woods while camping. I do not believe it was Russian, I was in the U.S. and getting a bear a travel visa is remarkably difficult.
I saw a Satellite going across the sky in 1983. At first we thought it was a meteor, but then the next day we read that it was a satellite. I could see it being confused for a plane on fire.
On a clear night I can see dozens of satellites going by, just none on fire or coming at me.
Man Claims He Was Captured And Abused By Martian Amazons!
Sounds fishy to me and wonder if she's just looking for publicity. If it crashed during the night, how could she have ascertained there was "black smoke" trailing the plane (with "orange lights")? Obviously if she "saw" (what appeared to be) a plane on fire during the day, of course she 'could have' seen the black smoke. Nonetheless, it seems plenty of search teams have already been in that part of the Indian Ocean, and they might have see debris.
Excessive "quotation marks", 'apostrophes' and (parentheses).
But no underline, italics or bold, fine reduced to $40.00
@Barbara; apparently a couple of the grammar cops...
Flight MH370 was accidentally shot down by either US or Malaysian fighter jets, who were jointly exercising in the area at that time. Both governments are covering this up to prevent an international scandal. The transponder and onboard communications were jammed by the military after the commercial jetliner was accidentally hit, to prevent the pilots from reporting the incident to the control tower.
I believe it as much as I believe people that say they saw Elvis. Shameful the things some people will do for a few minutes of attention.
My Question is why did it take her so long to report this. Once the media coverage started about the missing plane she should have come forward with this info since it was obvious no other planes reported seeing them.
In Michigan, every year or two some joker makes a claim that they know where Jimmy Hoffa is buried. And every time it happens, the taxpayers are stuck paying for a huge search job with tons of construction equipment and personal. Even if they found his dead body, #$%$ difference would it make at this point? Anyways, the Malaysian airplane is going to be the new Jimmy Hoffa.
I love articles like this one! Can't prove it---can't disprove it!! Come on; give me a small break here. You really want us to believe with all the media hype that was flying around back then, that this woman sat on this info until now?
I suggested this possibility the day the disaster was announced (ref. possibility that a military missile downed the airliner). I however believe it was a "Chinese" missile that was launched. Chinese are flexing their muscles all over the China Seas, bullying Vietnam, Phillipines and Japan. They know that if the world found out of their incompetence, they'd lose all credibility with the rest of the world, thus sinking their economy and influence!
Katherine Tee now has her 15 minutes of fame.
I can't exactly say this woman makes a credible witness.
The boat shown is a digital mockup and has nothing to do with the actual sailboat.
Usually when I want people to believe in me, I dont say thing like, I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.
Her story sounds a bit odd to me, perhaps she WAS hallucinating or just looking for her 15 minutes of fame.
There is no R in Washington.
It's one thing to not understand what she saw, but she "thought she was hallucinating"? Is hallucinating a regular problem with her? I know of nobody who would casually admit to hallucinating! She needs therapy, rehab, or a kick in the stern!
Yes, she may be crazy but, this could fall right in line with the issue of the Li-Ion batteries carried on that flight. If they overheated and caused a fire, that could have caused the pilots to turn the plane around while still out of communication. By the time they were turned they could have all been dead and the plane continued on the last heading until it went down. Think about the circumstances of the plane that Payne Stewart the golfer was on when it went down.
AND THERE IS NOTHING FLOATING IT ALL JUST SANK
But it would NOT explain the two planes high over it.
The two planes would be at the normal cruising altitude of about 35,000 ft while the pilots of the Malaysian flight would reduce their altitude to about 12,000 ft or below in case of lost cabin pressure.
Commenter, how many times have you looked up in the sky and seen multiple planes flying in different directions? I see it all the time. This is not unusual.
DD, batteries that catch fire and start burning the plane DO cause u-turns!
She waited this long and STILL only gives the vaguest of vague locations ? ? ? Between Thailand and India ? There's been dozens of proposed flight paths. Which one ? What place and date and time ? Maybe smoke, maybe orange lights, maybe fire, maybe this, maybe that, maybe nothing ...blah, blah. I saw a plane on fire, but oh well ... It sounds more like a case of "Hey, look at me ! I'm not giving anyone enough information to be helpful, but I do want insert myself into this. So, please, please, please, LOOK AT ME !"
Bourne - It's safe to come in now.
Or maybe you just don't know what your talking about. First you are not air traffic control of Malaysia there is most likely an on board navigation information she can easily turn over pinpointing her exact location down to the square-foot, yet not included here because it's not useful for a yahoo article. Second, as of now, yes they have decided on a flight path. Thirdly, again it says she compared the two meaning she gots it unless you are China's PM don't worry about it just because yahoo has #$%$ coverage doesn't say anything about her. Fourth, most cops can tell a liar by a fake because the true tails are non linear and are a mismash of sights and sounds. If you can tell an extremely linear story than there has been some heavy editing, that for the most part that's great when you are at a cocktail party but here it seems legit. Shoot forgot you first question, damn so to answer that she was sailing disconnected from the world and when she got on shore she probably was not concerned or connected to global events. It took me a month to hear about Osama and I was on land. And she probably wasn't in a country that spoke English. Plus the coverage did die down for a while maybe by the time she was paying attention to global news it had passed.
Wait a sec.She saw black smoke at night? And why would she think she was hallucinating? I can think of some sure fire reasons for hallucinating.
Middle of the ocean at night can be bright if there is a full moon. As for hallucinations, maybe she just means she thought her eyes were playing tricks on her ........ as when you stare at something for a long time at night.
Ms Tee, this story captivated the world, countless hours and manpower on the ground at sea looking for the plane, got people hooked on Internet satellite to look for the plane obsessively, however, you chose to stay silent? ???? Speechless
Well, we're not going to blame you honey. What we're going to do is thank you if the information you are giving us is credible. This could be the biggest break in what happened since the location of the sailboat is NOT where the "airline specialists" were searching for the plane...
I am fairly certain that this plane will not be found using conventional methods. It might be found by luck or chance but not with conventional ways. The plane might have drifted far by now and covered by dirt/sand as well as not looking on the right place. We even don't know if the plane landed in water, floated around a bit or just dived straight to the water. Just imagine Emilia Earnheart. She was lost in a place that is not as remote as this plane.
God knows what she saw. Really weird that she reported after all this time. Lady--you sees something like that don't just keep mum regardless of whether you thought someone else would have reported it. But then she could have been drunk along with her husband.
can't imagine they were both drunk. their lives depended on them using all their faculties.
Oh God, now CNN is going to go back to 24/7 news coverage about this.
I doubt it, for a reason.
So the plane has been burning for a few hours before stopping shaking hand with the satellite?
In spite of eye witness reports like this in addition to another one when a worker on an oil rig who saw something that looked like an air plane on fire, the searchers have to continue with their search near Australia, it is not clear if they are really searching to find something or just going through the motions for some other purposes of their own.
“There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,” she said. “They had normal navigation lights. I remember thinking that if it was a plane on fire that I was seeing, the other aircraft would report it.” I suspect that she saw a meteorite or a mirage. Her GPS should give a coordinate for the sighting and the fact that two other planes were seen means that these can be identified. If she really did see two other planes, then that would give some veracity to her claim.
They know exactly what happened to it. Can you say patent?
I'd be more embarrassed to say something now more than ever, if I were her. How much self-confidence does it take to make a phone call, even anonymously? And just what made her come forward now? 15 minutes?
With today's technology, they can't find an airliner? Right...
I saw the Obamas in Hawaii and I know it was them. I did not tell anyone because I know they would not believe me.
An oilrig worker reported seeing a burning plane at the time of the disappearance, but he was ignored. I doubt they will ever find that plane.
IMO its possible they shot this plane down because it was hijacked and afraid of terrorism. Now the govnt are keeping it hush hush to the public and pretending they cant find the plane. Cmon with all the technologies and satellites we have and they still can't find it.
Really? Sounds like another half baked conspiracy theory for me.
I believe her. The reason the authorities haven't found this plane, is because the government that is responsible for shooting it down, does not want it found.
I guess it's legal to smoke crack in the open seas. I'll bet she saw the plane being flown by pilot Wong Wei, co-pilot Jimmy Hoffa, and flight navigator D.B. Cooper. The other 2 planes were the Spruce Goose being flown by E.T. and a B-36 bomber being flown by Pontius Pilot.
If this is true then the woman's an idiot for not reporting this earlier.
mforder, she's an idiot one way or another.
I and a couple of friends were swimming in the river one day, jumping from the bridge in town and swimming out to an old bridge column where we sit for awhile to watch others jump off the bridge. Suddenly I spotted a large fireball passing across the sky! I dove into the river, swam to shore and ran home to call the police. It turned out to be a large meteor that was being tracked, but they had lost it until my call. Now I don't know about you folks, but If I were bobbing around on the ocean and saw what I believed to be a jet liner burning across the sky, I'd report it to the local authorities, immediately!
There are no local authorities in the ocean.
You DRINK Whiskey or Hard Cider?
In the middle of the Indian Ocean who exactly would you report it too?
They have radios and cell phones on boats. They can report anything to any authority anywhere, just like airplanes. Why didn't she report this after she got home when it was all over the media? I think she's just trying to get attention and didn't see anything really.
I dunno man, but thats a #$%$ awesome and relevant story for sure. You should use that to pick up chicks
Cell phone- seriously? I've been on the ocean for 22 years now and have never seen any cell towers out there. I can't even get reception from my house, let alone 2000 miles from shore.
Thank you Ted. I'm in the same boat (no pun intended..... or maybe so) reception at home is bad enough. In the middle of the ocean? Hahahaha, she must be joking, right? You would have better luck using smoke signals from one of your onboard flares. Lol
Coast gaurd. SHe could have notified the CG. DUH
Now lets all act stupid @ BlabbyBob. You handle says it all. just stupid!!!!
ok...so no cell phone. but I am sure a short wave of some kind on board.
Maybe the other planes shot it down, so, probably wouldn't report it.
I think she should of reported it to FLIPPER. He's really good about finding missing stuff in the ocean. Well at least he use to be 50 years ago......:-))
Agree with bob 100%. Her sounds more propaganda
that's funny! you are no sailor.
All the people on the boat who saw the fiery UFO coming down had to do was pinpoint the place they were at the time and report that. Boats DO have GPS on them these days, don't they? It's bogus.
A new Zealand Rig Worker. working on an Oil rig in the South China sea owned by Vietnam, claimes he saw what he thinks was MH370 on Fire. He Emailed Malaysia and Vietnam to report this. Report or not report, it seems the Relevant Authorities have their own version of events-Only!
its fair enough that this couple mr & mrs Tee come forward to finally reveal what they might've seen that nite. what didnot happen was that they did not tell until now. we must not question why they didnot report it earlier.. it could've happen to anyone. but i have to agree that it would be proper if this couple come forward to the authority now.. it could be another lead though. afterall.. its better late than never.
Gene who shot the plane down? Probably China as just before this incident happened they were in a dispute with China. China's been arguing with all the East Asian nations about ocean access.
Oh you Bozos crack me up! LOL Most ocean going vessels have radios...you know ship to shore and I'm sure many have satellite phones now, too.
agree with you on that one.....
hahahahhahaha OMG Sarah is on fire but anyway its too late to disclose it coz not even a bone of a human being can be traced in the ocean crocodiles and fish already consumed them.TOOO LATE thats why we think its a lie lady
I saw MH370 in the Gulf of Mexico. I will tell my story to the highest bidder.
@John - Both at the same time. Contemplating buying me a drink? Cheers!
@Cguzmanful - Moonshine is good too!
Iran is very important in the history of human culture. We should stop antagonizing them and be more neutral. We created a Frankenstein in the Middle East. Do you blame Israel's neighbors for wanting the same deadly weapons we helped Israel develop. We never should have stuck our noses into the Middle East, going back to the day of Eisenhower.
At this point of investigation, anything like this is important for the search. It's desperation time and whatever that relates to the incident should not be taken for granted. This could be a good lead for the location of the plane.
That is one bad move. The worst part was when she said 'Will this help the authorities of the families get closure? I have no idea … but I chose to sweep it under the carpet and now I feel really bad,” This story made the family of the victims more miserable.
Does anyone think for one second that if the plane was on fire with black smoke trailing while it was spotted in between Thailand and India that it ever would have made it to the southern Indian Ocean (west of Australia) where satellites last picked it up? If that plane was on fire and burning bright enough for someone sailing to see, then the plane would've crashed long before ever reaching the southern Indian Ocean. (Also, if it was late at night (2 am? 3 am?) how would she have seen black smoke behind the plane, what, 35,000' up? Surprised she didn't say that the 2 aircraft flying away weren't saucer shaped.
You make valid points. Too bad the news media fails to make a similar examination of the claimed facts.
it hasn't even been PROVED that it WAS close to Australia now, they can't make up their minds so it could basically be ANYWHERE! NO-ONE knows where it is, unless of course YOU have all the answers and are not telling us??????
LOL... no I don't personally know what happened to it, but yes they DO have proof that it was flying as far south as the southern Indian Ocean within Australia's search and rescue area. They have the IMMARSAT and Doppler data which shows the satellite was in hourly "contact" with the plane thru a series of pings. And yes, they are sure it was THAT plane. They have the proof that THAT plane flew for approximately 7 hours after they lost it... something that wouldn't have happened if this crackpot saw it engulfed in flames. They are currently sending deep diving subs and there is a Chinese survey ship mapping, all mapping the floor of the southern Indian Ocean in preparation for what may be a year long ocean floor search for the plane. Do you think they'd be spending millions on that particular area of ocean diving 15000' (2000' deeper than Titanic's resting place in the North Atlantic), if they thought for one second it could be somewhere in a much smaller area between Thailand and India?
No, I think there is much more to this than they are admitting AND that this woman is indeed a lying crackpot!
So they were sailing without any radio? They had no ship's log to note longitude and latitude of the find? They had no camera? Her husband did not attest to seeing it, just her? Oh boy!!!
Bet she was licking those hallucinogenic frogs that night and riding on the back of her sofa at home.
It would not hurt to check out her story. I live in southern California where we have many brush fires and you CAN see smoke in a dark sky. The smoke tends to be lighter than the night sky. For that matter, you can also see clouds in a night sky. They are also lighter. I don't know if she actually saw a plane or not, but she waited an awfully long time to report it, unless she was afraid people would think she was nuts...
Or she is just seeking her 15 minutes of fame. After all it has only been in excess of 2 months since this happened.
Considering the inept way the investigation's gone, any and all eye witness evidence needs to be vetted carefully. Not sure how credible she is but being on a sailboat in the IO on the night MH370 vanished gives her some credibility. One would think any sort of inflight emergency like a fire would enable the crew to send off at least one distress call, but if that large stash of lithium ion batteries in the cargo hold smoldered to the point of giving off enough noxious fumes to incapacitate the crew prior to a full blown fire in the cargo bay, her sightings would make lots of sense.
Gee TJ baboon, you must be part of the official investigation considering how moronic that was.
except, the fumes would not shut down the systems!
Paulie, you don't get lithium ion fires. They smolder very hot for an extended time if the batteries enter a thermal runaway condition but fire can begin depending on what the batteries are in contact with.
what attracts my attention of this woman is, why does she have so much doubt of what she saw with her own eyes?, why is she not trusting on herself? that makes me thing that she have experienced hallucinations before, either caused by the use of drugs or mental illness, so a person who doubts on her own mind is not trustable....If I see a plane on fire, Obama walking on the street, Brad Pitt or what ever weird I could see around, I would not have doubts of believing what my own eyes are seeing... so that women is just a pot head.
A fisherman saw the same thing in roughly the same waters. He was ignored.
I think she should go to live in Colorado.
Her husband was asleep at the time? When she told him that she thinks she was hallucinating, he just agreed with her? She doesn't have friends? If she does, she never told them? And if she did, none of them told her to contact the authorities immediately? Isn't the media's job to ask the questions that the public wants answered?
The media is stupid. That's how obummer got elected.
Cocaine is a terrible drug. I hope she goes to rehab pronto.
In 1983 the Soviet Union shot down Korean Airliner Flight 007. They thought it was a spyplane. In 1988 the United States shot down Iranian Airliner Flight 655 mistaking it for an F-14 Tomcat Fighter. It is a likely possibility that another country mistakenly shot this airliner down. Probably covering the incident up after.
I also saw it from my front porch and two planes knocked it out of the sky. I live in Texas, so I must have very good eyesight. Anything for publicity these days. Had it been shot down no witnesses would be left behind.
Please don't let CNN find out about this. I can't take another five weeks of round-the-clock blathering about nothing. CNN is like watching Rome burns while Nero fiddles. CNN is Nero while Benghazi, Bergdahl, the VA, the IRS, the NSA, etc. are Rome.
Total BS. . . She is looking for fame and possibly money. . .. So a airplane flies towards one country, turns around flies the other way, and within a few 100 miles of crashing into nowhere, it bursts into flame before plummeting into the ocean and disappearing. And we have a soul witness seeing this flaming airplane. . . My question is: Lets question HER, maybe she is part of the cover up of the whole situation. . .being paid to say such nonsense, or part of the cover up itself.
She is part of a top-secret government scheme to cooperate with alien invaders who shot the plane down and took it to their home planet for scrap materials and human flesh, which they find very delicious and is a delicacy there. I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true.
She did not report it because she said there were 2 other planes flying near it and she believed that the air traffic controllers were aware of the situation already. I wont hurt to find out what her travel path was while she was sailing. If she has a cell phone, there is a way that the path she travelled is tracked via the GPS system. It would indicate the route. For the families of these individuals, any lead is better than none.
but who were the other 2 planes...the flight went off total radar we have ben told for some time now.....was it shot down?
...Or she's just a sick wannabesumbody that's full of #$%$!
Clearly, news about the search efforts for the plane were available 24/7 around the world, yet for three months she thought the "higher planes" had reported the sighting? Something doesn't make sense in the article. Maybe there are other details which may become available but right now........?
regular cell phone won't work in middle of ocean, unless you have one expensive sat-cell...so why turn it on? Anyway, boat has GPS system. I just don't know they required to have record tracking information or not; However, I think this lady just want 15-minutes fame. Her story doesn't seem complete!
The NSA should be able to help her with the cell data... I'm sure they have her info on file.
BREAKING NEWS: Cell phones do NOT work in the middle of the ocean. Cell phones are NOT TRACKED in the middle of the ocean. Until they anchor a fleet of ships at every corner of 50 mile box across every ocean with cell phone towers on them Cell Phones are NOT going to work in the middle of the ocean! What does work in the middle of the Ocean are Satellite Phones, but for small vessels most of the time those are turned off because each call is very expensive to make. (ocean freighter may leave their Sat Phones on, but this was a sailboat NOT an ocean freighter) . Marine HF is the most common mid ocean communication tool for small vessels, NOT Sat phones btw, This boat may not have even had a Sat Phone on board.
i was on my jet-ski in the middle of the pacific that wee hours in the morning and i saw what i thought then as a meteorite. I ignored it because i was sleepy and have to concentrate with the jetski, not to mention that i was busy reading a text message from my daughter. I woke up the following morning to see the news about a missing plane at the same spot where i was jet-skiing but i did not say anything because i was afraid that no one would believe me. Now, with all these news about the missing flight, I feel guilty for not reporting it immediately then so i am coming out and ready to tell the media what I saw that night. Money is not important but I welcome a substantial cash gift from anyone who would like to interview me. I am not greedy so a 7-figure will suffice, all for the sake of community service.
Hard to believe her story. A British couple, suppose to be intelligent , did not report a plane on fire, come on she is dumb or what?
Some people will say anything for publicity.
It sounds as if she's trying to tell us two other jets may have shot down flight MH-370...Sounds pretty suspicious to me...
Let's face it, we won't find this plane for many, many years to come. If they were going to find it they would have found it by now. The way they "investigated" what happened is very suspicious and they didn't do a very good job.
this may take years for them to find but i think they will eventually find it somewhere.
So the plane has been on fire all the way from Malaysia to the southern Indian Ocean? These two must have been really out of it.
This seems entirely credible and logical. I hope the authorities get on this immediately and begin searching where this woman saw the plane. There is no time to waste and every ---Whoa! ---- What the --? Be back in a minute. I just saw Elvis walking in front of my house with a boombox held to his ear.
You got me to laugh. Thanks
I am inclined to believe her story as I hold that a conspiracy was aloof when the plane was shot down ... too many flip flop statements in what the Malaysian officials said ... those statements actually misdirected the search for the plane in the precious early hours after it officially disappeared ...
An experienced sailor, as this woman is said to be, would not let a sighting like she describes go unreported. All vessels are required to have ship to shore radio, and make regular radio contact. So her story has some serious problems, as does her credibility.
And you don't report this? Really?
If I am with someone and I see something questionable, then I call them over, have them look to make sure I am not dreaming and verify what I am seeing. Then I would proceed to notify the authorities
Kinda late to come forward with this information now. What the hell??
So why didn't the two planes overhead report the burning plane wreckage? Could it be that they were military planes that had just accidentally/mistakenly/purposely shot down the passenger jet?
Interesting story! Whatever became of the story from the guy on the oil dredge saying he saw a ball of fire in the sky?
I don’t know but New Zealander Mike McKay who was working on an oil rig off the coast of Vietnam, whose location was Lat 08 22’ 30.20” N Lat 108 42.22.26” E., saw a burning plane in the same direction that flight MH370 should have been. I wonder if she can give us more information to allow comparison. Maybe she saw the same thing. It could be more confirmation of a problem with the plane.
If he only saw it for 10 seconds and then it went out he was probably observing a a meteor entering our atmosphere. 10 seconds is a long time to view a meteorite but a larger one could easily go for 10 seconds before it burned out.
G.M. and Dogman - I just read a blog someone wrote. The writer is Tim Yeakel. This is what he writes: Clark I heard similar intell myself. I was told the plane was shot down. I had a sailor tell me he and members of his crew saw at least 2 missiles in flight over that area and the flash. We had 2 nuke subs in that area. So there is a reason that aircraft is not found... The sailor and crew were later interrogated and told to shut their mouths or face a deep dark hole in some south western desert.... I am assuming the aircraft were Chinese in origins... I believe it is all linked to their new aircraft carrier as well.... That's my conspiracy theory. The sailors I know don't tell fish stories... With that I have also read about a high volume of some kind of batteries that were being transported, that most likely put fumes into the passenger area first, making the crew unaware til it was too late. Do you remember that plane off the coast of NYC (?), some saying they saw a missile take it out?
Benefit of doubt! MAS MH370 has the tracking shut off while in flight over countries with radar system, fighters jets were scrambled by a pair to intercepted for invaded air space AND no response despite contacted with MAS MH370, images of 911 resurface in the minds, (1) shot down MAS MH370 since it does not response (2) Opps, its a commercial jets with passangers AND with international attention then, say not a word (3) who is going to know anyway, the ocean is vast The END
if shot down at least a small piece of debris would have been found by now,however on the basis of being in a countries airspace and jets being scrambled being forced down on land could be more likely and explain why no debris has been found
she needs to be tracked, maybe with an ankle bracelet.
vincent f reasonable response but did you not know the searched area for voer a month were a few thousand south toward the Perth, Australia while the couple noted where is close up between India and Indoesia, Cambodia, she did mention a pair of light going separate direction from the burned debris in the sky AND would these country/ies admit the error, until now no one knows if it was a group terrorists or just an individual pilot but you and I know all tracking and sound systems was turn off therefore without a response would it be shot down?
This is turning into another case of big foot where everyone will claim they have seen it.
She thought she was going insane? Either this woman is an idiot, or she's an idiot.
Which government, miguel? There are soooo many involved here, so many borders. So many interests. All of them have fighter jets, and, who knows? There is no way we can tell if this woman saw anything. Does make one wonder.
Let me guess here, the Lockheed 88 Electra pictured in this column is really an Australian EP-3 and it was searching for the missing plane, not the missing plane. Nice explanation and missing detail. The other detail that is missing is that a sailboat on a voyage from India to Thailand would only have intersected the missing aircraft route near the western mouth of the Straights of Malacca. This would place the aircraft about 7 hours north of where everyone is looking. Hummnn...a little more detail from the observer would be nice. I'm with the others here, this is a load of #$%$ unless you come up with an apx. heading and your ship's position for this event.
Awesome investigative Job , what a woman Hoax, a diversion
She saw it at "night" and saw black smoke trailing it! really?
amakua1: Your first sentence doesn't make sense.
I am sure that Malaysia and a couple of other ASEAN countries do not want to hear your logical conclusion, amakua1... But it makes more sense to me than having to believe that an international search force cannot even find debris in the area they have been searching...
Yeah bobby, its not like there are stars or a moon in the sky to illuminate it. Or even the actual fire that is creating the smoke.
Any smoke would look black at night,,...Would you feel better if she said white smoke,,..///Honestly !!!!!
kola: they only meant that the plane pictured is a recon plane. Not the plane that went missing.
Tree bark, i dont know aircraft but white smoke is coolant in the combustion chamber, black smoke is oil.
its possible the trail of smoke was white or light blue if the pilot had to add a quart of oil every thousand oil cause he never warms up tyhe engine. And Yes, night is not always pitch black so it may be quite illuminated, epecially if you are inhaling all your illegal drugs before you dock in Thailand
rolling... you dont know tre bark either.... white smoke is valve stem seals or high heat sediments such as excess gas, low volume oil or moisture, black smoke is high volume oil or low heat sediments
The sailboat is the new version of the boat used on the show Gilligan's Island. It's on a three hour tour waiting for a storm to blow it to an uncharted island near Hawaii.
It is a probable conclusion to this story...the plane went off course and turned off all communication, transponders, etc. a country sent two military jets to check it out and when they approached and the pilot did not respond they were ordered to shoot it down to ensure that it did not change course and crash into a populated area or building...remember many talking heads questioned why Malaysia or Indonesian military did not scramble jets to check out the plane and try to determine what was wrong. This makes sense...no country wanted to say that they were the one that ordered jets to shoot down the plane so billions are spent in the search in the wrong area.
I don't believe a word this idiot is saying!
I think they will find sasquatch in the Indian Ocean before they find this missing plane.
looks like most everybody dismissed her story, probably about the same number that were certain pings were coming from the planes black box in the ocean near Australia more than a month after the plane went missing. It sort of reminds me of a woman who claimed she nearly collided with OJ Simpson the night Ron and Nicole were murdered and they looked directly at each other. A tabloid paid her for her story but first made her take 3 polygraph tests from 3 different experts. Marsha Clark refused to call her as a witness "because she profited from the story", but the real reason might have been the timeline. The lady claimed that the near collision happened at around 1035 pm because she looked at her watch and Marsha Clark wanted the time of the murders to have occurred at 1015 pm.
OJ came to my mind too (god, I am old).
So what? The time line simply would have placed them together after or as he was leaving the scene instead of going to it (before the murders). Either way, her testimony would have placed him at the scene close enough to the time of the murders to further implicate him.
That jury could have had a video tape of the murders, a confession and witnessed by 300 people and they still wouldn't have convicted him.
An ironic photo was taken when O.J. was convicted in Las Vegas for a sports memorabilia theft. The man escorting him from the courtroom wore a jacket that said: MARSHALL CLARK COUNTY But the manner in which the photo was cropped left only the lettering: MARSHA CLARK Okay, so karma can't spell. But I got a kick out of it.
I KNEW OJ had something to do with this!
OJ's acquittal by an almost all black jury was payback for Rodney King. Period.
If I'm not mistaken, another man thought he saw the plane go down in a fireball and slowly touch down in the same area. The seas there are rough and the current is strong. God help the familys of those lost in this horrible accident.
So many stories surrounding the missing plane. If what the British lady says is true, why were there 2 other planes above the airliner "on fire". Why didn't the other aircraft report anything? Maybe the missing Malaysian airliner was shot down. That would explain the lack of information.
Seems like the sight of anything unusual causes this woman to have a mental breakdown.
I totally believe her. Sounds completely logical and not at all ridiculous and made up.
You're a special kind of crazy, aren't you?
The two other planes were the Indonesian fighters returning to base.
I can believe that she may have seen fire at night, but how could she see black smoke which would be invisible in a night sky?
This is a lead-up to a book. Just wait and see (though I doubt SHE ever saw anything).
How does this picture of a fake boat with grey figurines relate to the story?
She spots this plane, but nobody on the other 2 saw a thing. Yup, that's convincing.
Interesting. 10 years ago, a south Korean jet liner was shot down by the North Korean missles for flying too close to North korea. According to this lady, two other planes fly the opposite direction. Were maybe jet fighters that shot MH370 down. That is why the Malaysia did not want to give any information about it. Phillippines, Vietnam both dislike china very much, maybe they shot down that jetliner with 155 Chinese on board.
Unless America provided aircraft for refueling the Philippines is excluded and Vietnam would have to fly over too many countries or have refueling to fly around.
India or the US shot it down?
don't know, but china certainly made many enemies in south china sea.
Oh Yeah, I remember now, I thought it was the pot, Right!
Kathy Tee , lay off the coke or weed or what ever you are on? I am assuming you out of drugs and out of money and needed to make up a good story to sell to the tabloids ? You and your husband waited this long to tell everyone???
Sometimes the mind plays tricks on our eyes; I thought I saw a Bigfoot in the Hamptons the other day but it just turned out to be a Kardashian...
i saw the newest pic of the jenner sister, gave me a bigfoot
With all the news coverage from the day it lost and she is just now coming forward, I don't thinks so.
Lady, with all due respect, you saw it in March and it's June, just about three months. We are not talking about a deer getting hit by a truck, we are talking about a plane full of people and an international incidence. It took you three months to reveal what could be a solid lead? I guess you have the right to question about your mental capacity.
"I questioned my mind. I was looking at what appeared to be an elongated plane glowing bright orange, with a trail of black smoke behind it. It did occur to me that it might be a meteorite. But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Looks like the other two plane picked up the plane on fire and disappeared. The mystery of this plane will continue just like JFK's, Merlyn Monroe's, Natalie Wood's for years to come to fulfill news.
Who is "Merlyn Monroe" ? She also said nothing about the "other two planes picking up the one burning". She said that they were "above it & flying off in a different direction". Do you watch for UFO's & Elvis too ?
I would question my mind to if I was high as a kite.
Natalie Wood's fate is no mystery. Robert Wagner killed her.
N Blanchard, clearly you have never done any long passage making, or even overnight sailing. If they were double handing it is likely hubby was down below asleep as they would likely have been sailing in shifts to make the passage, and probably suffering from sleep deprivation. The aloneness, the sensory and sleep deprivation, and other strange things you see, hear, and feel on these passages can quite literally make you question your sanity. Yet we do it for fun :)
It was prob just a firefly expelling a little gas.
Don't forget Emelia Airhart shes out there somewhere also !
Merlyn Monroe was Marilyn Monroe's famous Wizard father.
N Blanchard is a meth head. Stay away from this person.
you spelled Marilyn Monroe's name wrong. Speel and the alphabet class for u tomorrow. Do not be late.
Who knows what this lady saw... Might have even been MH 370... Either way, too bad she didn't use the RADIO at the time... I would not sleep soundly if this person were on night watch, if something hit the yacht, would she report it, or trust that the two planes flying above would ???
This woman doesn't think much of her own mental status if she thought she might be hallucinating or going insane.
I will say it one more time look in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal.
And the conspiracy theorists are now set for life.
And she saw a space ship and alians jumping off the wing of the plane!
a story like this makes it more unbelievable that no one has found a trace of this plane if there was any validity to her story-should be parts of plane all over that section of water if it was truly burning to the degree she says--and why has no one else come forward- burning planes are a lot easier to spot than a jet being hiacked
This story of the lost airplane has been circulated for so long now. Just let it go. There's nothing we can do. I can't imagine how much manpower, resources, fuel, so many countries involved for this aircraft disappearance, it's so unsurmountable. Who'll pay for this search effort? The Malaysians messed up so let them take care of their own problem.
I don't disbelieve her. When you look up in the sky especially at night your eyes need to adjust and orient to the space, the light, the stars. It would be easy to dismiss what you 'thought' you saw when you start second guessing yourself and IF there were two other planes even in the distance, on some level she may have been frightened to come forward. There are other reports from at least one other who saw something similar, a man who was working on rigs though I don't know his location in proximation to hers.
My belief is that she (and the fellow on the oil rig) saw a meteorite. We have the satellite "ping" record that shows the trail of the plane in the sky for at least 7 hours after it disappeared, and that was off the coast of Australia.
I suppose it's possible they both saw a meteorite yet I don't think it's impossible that they both may have seen this plane. The man on the rig was said to have reported what he thought he had seen, which was what to him looked like a plane on fire.
This gives more credibility to the guy who came out with the book suggesting that the aircraft was accidentally shot down by US/Fillipino forces during joint war exercises in the area.
No parts of the missing plane has been found to date. Why isn't anybody following up on the possibility that the plane was Hijacked, and is sitting somewhere, and by miracles, the passengers are STILL alive? It just may have happened this way. Why are they so quick to rule it out?
Why does Yahoo use a picture of a toy boat for this article?
I've heard that that plane carried a cargo of Lithium batteries. Maybe thats why the plane was a red glow.??
So the batteries in storage caught fire?
far enough away that she cant tell if it is a plane or a meteorite but she questions her sanity. I think this lady is a little unstable.
People don't sit on information like this for months. She is a liar.
So, there were other planes around the missing flight? And the missing plane was putting out black smoke? Was it shot down for being off its flight plan and having its communication system turned off? So many questions we may never get the answers to.
I saw it, too, from my back porch in Florida. MH370 was surrounded by green glowing disks. Then, I ran out of beer.
VERY interesting that she saw two planes flying above it!!! That means that SOMEBODY KNEW WHAT HAPPENED and did not inform the families of those on board--something stinks about this. There could have well been some closure for these families had she just reported what she saw when she saw it and let the authorities handle it!!!
If she was a homosexual ball player, or actor yahoo would follow this story for a month or more. If she was kim k or kayne west yahoo would follow it every day for years
Black smoke... at night? Not enough confidence in herself to report what she saw but has enough confidence to sail from India to Thailand? Maybe she saw it, maybe she didn't. But she's definitely a strange one.
You can bet she would have come forward sooner had it been hr family on the flight.
The plane was taken by aliens, someone told me.
Our apologies madam for disturbing your journey on a peaceful, abundant, and materialistic lifestyle while innocent people were plunging to their death. Sincerely Milaysia Airlines. This woman was so far from reality are you kidding me. Imagine if anyone passing by saw her boat sinking and decided after a few months to report it as well...effin people!
Whatever. Another nut case comes forward.
I bet she saw the boogeyman too. Anything for her 15...
Exactly as I suspected. Malaysian ship, or aircraft accidently fired, or fired on the craft, blowing it up instantaneously. That explains, the wild goose chases, and delays. Probably sending the search crews, in the most distant opposite areas, of the planes likely crash. I've seen missiles accidently fired from US warships, luckily only once hitting a plane, but that plane was targeted. I've seen CIWS go haywire, and shoot around the ship 360 degrees, damaging masts, and decks...The way Malaysia has been acting, it looks like a coverup..
Yep, ok Jean Desses. What ever you say. I bet you are seeing a whole team of psychiatrists aren't you???
I'd believe her before anyone claiming to follow a PING or unprecedented ways to be wrong.
if you're sailing out at sea, isn't it your natural instinct to be more AWARE of your surroundings and log every unusual thing that's happened bec your life may depend on it later ? your adrenaline is heightened when your in unchartered waters so how could they not report this incident to anyone when they got back ? something as unusual as a plane on fire?? CMON LADY...
I didn't think nothing of it at the time but i saw the plane go down in the Gulf of Mexico. How much will the tabloids pay me for my story?
It is strange that one cannot tell from the story (or is it just me?) to whom she first reported her observations. Did she call a government entity, a tabloid, or who? The story is attributed to Business Insider, but it does not say they were the entity to whom she actually made her report. Even though I may not be big on trusting the government, I am pretty sure I would call the government rather than some internet source, if for no other reason than to spare the families more torment. So, knowing to whom she reported her observations would go a long way toward resolving credibility issues, for me anyway.
Proof that you shouldn't smoke crack and sail.
The government would be the last entity I would report to...
I would not be comfortable reporting to the government either, Incognito, but it would probably be my choice by default.
What does her husband have to say. She said they were "sailing together" to Thailand???
Hi! I have some things to report to the government. Could you please give me their number?
Well, she may have had reported it to the government first but what if they did not take her seriously and dismissed her story.
Her story was probably sitting at the bottom of the Malaysian flight lost bin at some news agency. Time to run it, apparently.
Better inform the media and as many media because some media are run by the government official who do not want any investigation as to what shot it down.
If she thought she was going insane, she must not be too well-wired in the first place, so what are the chances that a mentally incompetent person would report something like that? I don't think this story is true, but if it is, do the two planes going in the other direction that was supposedly above the fiery vision, mean they shot the plane down? I don't believe anything anyone has said about this happening. It's a ruse.
If you believe anything Business Insider comes up with, congratulations! You are now an honorary member of the Koch family. No money, but you are a vampire. How could anyone (especially on Yahoo! news, the lowest of the low) make an intelligent comment about the plane when no one knows where it is? If ESP and psychic powers are real, how come no one out of 7 billion people on Earth knows where the plane is?
She stated it was not reported at time. Take a reading class.
The being "shot down" story doesn't hold water (pun NOT intended), because the question is why the airplane turned around and headed in another direction long before this woman saw (?) it. As well, did she report the coordinates as to where she was when she saw it? Don't sailors who are sophisticated enough to travel the ocean the way she and her husband were doing log those things?
hoax written all over it... have some respect for the poor souls on that plane & their families.
Well, with moonlight or even against a starlit sky; it might be possible to see smoke trailing an aircraft on fire. The Chinese have been making an ongoing flexing of military prowess in the area, and about the time this plane went missing. I suggested back then that they may have been fired upon. Now, the last thing anybody wants at this time is to open up a Pandora's box that would certainly lead to an escalation of war! At any rate, I think there's something not quite right here that's afoot!
Get your geography correct. The area between India and Thailand is not in dispute with the Chinese.
Doubt the Chinese would fire on a plane full of rich Chinese!
well, to ad to this, and i am just saying, the chinese are the ones who heard the supposed pings, hundreds of miles away from where they last chatted with the plane. what if they did accidently shoot it dow, are are trying to cover it up
Where is your evidence to support the information you are telling us.
Story doesn't make any sense, anyone with 1/2 a brain would have reported something like that! But she is correct - must be not going insane, just plain nuts!
She's got a great imagination, but no credibility.
It would be nice if she had said where. From India to Thailand leave plenty of space
The Malacca Straits water depth is less than 50 meters on average and should be a relatively easy and cheap place to search. Individual divers can even reach bottom too.
To see something that odd and not report it is totally insane!
I think she is hallucinating right now...
It's official, 'Common Sense' must now be a part of the curriculum for school children because that ish is gone!
Couldn't believe her eyes so kept quiet. Journalist couldn't keep their mouth shut and started talking before they thought to ask questions and think.
She also so a unicorn in her back yard.
she didnt see me in her yard!
That woman looks really weird. There's something wrong with her.
After all this time, NOW she reports a possible sighting ? I can't even begin to understand that.
If she saw 3 planes at one time, two above MAF360, then airline records can show the fight paths and track it down from there. If not then this proves the other two planes were Malaysian military jets returning and circling to confirm a kill. And authorities can still find the jetliner and notify the world of its loss and still avoid the cause repercussions.
She's almost as loony as the loons who say terrorists took it and have it in Pakistan or some such other country.
I get the feeling this is yet another false lead given by someone who wants very much to see their name in the papers.
simple the plane was hijacked by the government killed all the people and made the plane disappear, i do not believe that you just dont find the plane this size, they will once all the evidence is gone they will find it. There were high official on that plane and rumors that a lot of gold was on that plane. This plane was hijacked, not by terrorist but the government its self. Believe That
very easy to lose a plane in the ocean. Heck, during this time the mudslide in Washington buried people, and searchers knew within a few yards of where they were, and it took days to find some of them....
Breaking CNN news, somebody says something.
With all the countries assisting with the search and finding nothing, I believe the passenger jet was hijacked, a fisherman said he saw a plane flying very low on the day in question, he did not mention any fire. Is it possible that this plane might be used on another attack in the US sometime in the future. If any group claimed responsibility, then everyone would know where to look. What about the passengers, WHO KNOWS. This is just a thought of mine, since most plane crashes leave some sort of debris field, and this one did not. All the advanced detection equiptment used by different countries involved came up with nothing. Could the Somali Pirates have switched from ocean going ships to air ships. ?????
it left debris but it is a very large ocean
I do not think hijacking is plausible. There are hundreds to thousands of used jet airplanes for sale around the globe everyday for sale to anyone with the money. Why steal a airplane and have to dispose of so many passengers when buying a used unit is so easy. The used ones are pretty worn out and go for cheap prices.
Michael, here is an answer to that question. Because it would cause the most terror and destruction. They don't want to just kill people. They want to destroy everything in their target's lives, including any sense of security for those who aren't killed. My guess is the same as the many out there who think it was a hijacking situation, and I also think that is what the recent trade of the soldier for the 5 terrorists was really for. In the news right before that occurred there were articles about a secret meeting at the white house, I think they might have been discussing how to attempt to deal with this without the people finding out and going nuts. It is a fact that mob mentality makes people really stupid, and so many people are sheep who would rather follow the herd than think for themselves (and by think for themselves I'm not referring to the narcissism so many seem to be afflicted with these days). If people knew that a plane was hijacked, all passengers murdered and then that same plane was used to murder many many more...do you really think everyone would continue flying? Sure many still would, but would there be enough of them to keep from causing a huge, HUGE problem/collapse? Again, I specify, this is just a GUESS. It -is- plausible because their goal is not murder, it is total destruction of civilization.
Imagine September 11th magnified by a hundred times. How would people react, really?
What a bunch of lies, the plane landed at Diego Garcia, one person got out a phone message.
Some discrediting comments seems to come from either employed juveniles or starved for attention adults. The report is corroborated by other witnesses publicly reported during the time more recent to the event. Perhaps that inevitable unraveling that results in a larger story and the truth is about to happen.
I am sure that the mystery of the ages as to how a huge jetliner loaded with cargo and passengers just disappears one night without one single trace will bring out a lot more tales and stories of mysterious Malaysian jetliner sightings for many years to come; or until they finally find the wreckage and flight recorder.
She was absolutely right not to believe her eyes.
Then she saw Bigfoot swimming by and later she rescued Elvis and JFK from a deserted island where aliens were holding them prisoner.
Her book will be out in September, given the lack of evidence to refute it.
This British woman has spent too much time in Benidorm. Her brain is sheet.
Wrong plane...That was the plane with the Harlem Globetrotters that crash landed on Gilligan's Island.
Stuff like this happens all the time. I saw a small plane detach from under the wing of a larger jet, ignite the engine and take off like a shot. It was super cool so I expected to hear about it on the news. Not a word and I couldn't even find another person who saw it. It would be nice to have a built-in camera.
Well, what was her position? Somewhere between India and Thailand, I presume, but where? Sounds made up, trying to imply two fighters shot it down. We already know it was flying for 7 hours. People will say anything, anytime.
Ok, another story had more credible information. Two other planes were well aloft going in the opposite direction. Sighting occurred on the hypothesized flight route as the plan was making it's southern turn down the west coast of Indonesia. North to south she says. Her delay was because of not hearing the news, and not putting 2 and 2 together given the subsequent days at sea. Their GPS logs matched the projected flight route. SO she either made it up, after finding out they could prove they were close to the pathway, or she really did see something. Not likely the plane was on fire like that. That would indicate a major engine fire and imminent crash. We know the airplane flew for 7 hours. So just the part about orange and black smoke may be wrong.
The thoughts of this plane ever to be found will be one in a million, depending on who you are, and where you last placed it. Mind you, it could have burst into flames and fallen into the ocean, hijacked by persons of interest, a UFO, the military or disappeared into some other triangle that we are not aware of yet. Whatever the case or whatever this woman may have witnessed that night on the seas, how would she have proved or disproved what she saw, considering she also saw two other planes. Therefore, many would have bounced her idea out of the water and looked at her as though she drank too much salt water. Would I have said something? Would I have taken at least a picture of this scene that I had witnessed? Perhaps, if I had a camera close by or my phone. But like Hillary said, "Does it really matter at this point?" Either the people in the plane are: Alive or deceased. Either way, we hope that they were readily prepared for their end of life, because we cannot determine when we will go. The timing for this plane was not to be found at this time had this call been made. Everything happens for a reason. We may not understand it or reason with it or accept it, but that is just the way it goes.
Accidental missile strike during a training exercise.
then where is the wreckage--missle strikes cause lots of wreckage-planes explode pieces here and there -way more chance for floating bodies
What if the missile didn't explode, or passed through the fuselage? Couldn't the plane have nosed in intact? Seems like it would be much harder to pinpoint one piece as opposed to hundreds of pieces.
That plane is not down there. I smell a conspiracy.
I thought the nuts wold come out a long time ago. CNN should have them on and have a marathon coverage on them.
She may have also seen Elvis hanging out with Bigfoot at Jimmy Hoffa's burial site behind a Burger King.
i dont hang with elvis, i like the woods, and i dont exist, shhhh
So exactly at what time and date did this so called observation take place? Yeah, I don't believe her eyes either!
Don't worry, CNN will be covering this news story all day today.
How much was she paid to say that so the families would have closure or maybe so the search can be called off.
the other two planes couldn't report it, because both planes pilots were probably sleeping.
Was she coming home from the Fantasy Island? She needs to Tee off.
Well.....maybe. After all, Malaysian government officials were not very forthcoming with information during the event. And I don't believe for a minute that a plane that size would enter their airspace without someone taking a closer look. It is certainly possible that their military shot it down.
She sounds super reliable, let's listen to her.
she saw a plane went down and she didn't try to pull out a video recorder or sail toward that place to see if she can rescue anyone.
Gee, thanks Katherine!! Very enlightening especially 3 Months after the fact. Hey, you probably saw Amelia Earheart's plane at the same time, but couldn't believe that either, right? I Personally I think you might need something more than this before hoping to get paid to go on Oprah's show or that other loser, Anderson Cooper
The woman loses credibility for delay in reporting. It is extremely difficult to understand why the incident would not have been radio'd in to the local coast or naval authorities. If radio was not available, any sane person would have reported it immediately upon arrival, and/or upon seeing the never-ending CNN coverage of the flight.
i think shes doing this for attention. how would she know if it was that exact flight with how small the letters are at a distance. shes making this #$%$ up or shes got eagle eyes
Stupid British woman for not reported earlier.
Affluent Arrogance not to have radioed a call. And now weeks later ? Maybe she saw Elvis too. AH
Every lead should be given attention.
Wonder if anybody else saw anything and didn't report it because they thought somebody else would? Then there is always the question of who to report something like this to -if you did see something. That is the toughest question. Who would believe you anyway? They would probably think you were nuts. Even with good GPS coordinates -they would probably call you crazy. After all -who believes any common person. Everyone believes big shots -but never believes any common person.
According to the evidence that was reported, this woman's account would NOT be correct, i.e. that Flt 370 was shot down. The issue was that the transponder on the plane was turned off yet it still flew for hours. Theoretically, although unlikely, it is could have landed somewhere.
THE WITNESS MAY BE VERY WELL TRUE, ONE OF ONLY FEW CONCLUSIONS WE COULD MAKE ON THE "MISSING" PLANE, WITH NO WRECKAGE AND NO OTHER ACCOUNTS OF WHAT HAPPENED, AS THE INFORMATION IS GATHERED, I KNOW SOON WE"LL HAVE AN ANSWER TO WHAT HAPPENED, WITH THIS NEW SIGHTING DETAILS, IT COULD ONLY MEAN THAT THE PLANE WAS "GEARED" TO GO TO A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE AND "DISINIGRADE" after bursting into flames, kinda like the effect of the 911 planes which nothing was left, and all melted down to the fire, FIRE and PLANES are something we should remember and FOCUS on for this "MISSING" PLANE CASE. The overall plan to reach a high altitude and then BURST into flames could have been apart of the "MOTIVE" as a "SUICIDAL" plane operator, with the pure and simple message, TAKING LIVES - CONTROL - POWER, and the key to this were the statements made by the "WIVES of the PILOTS" - THEIR RELIGION comment, if you will all revert back to what they said. SEE: MEDIA. Jennifer J. Bland
Please don't yell! The pain the pain....
You'll recover , Uncle...But you might want to work on those delicate sensibilities.
JenniferB Do you not know that by using Caps your are yelling? Get rid of the Capital letters girl!
i think she meant to yell
Tell me something... how would this plane get from "all clear" to in flames flying above the Indian Ocean without a call for help? Now you're probably going to say maybe the fire rendered them unconscious or something similar (plane ascended to smother the flames) as all the others have stated correct? 5+ hours away it is spotted on fire by this lady which would rule out ascending, since it was still ablaze, and if the fire was strong enough to render the crew, passengers and pilots unconscious due to smoke inhalation it would have spread throughout the plane rather quickly correct? So her (and yours if you believe her) basic hypothesis is that this thing flew on autopilot for all that time without succumbing to the laws of Thermodynamics? Just a question?
She works for the Garrett Morris, Saturday Night Live, School for the Hard of Hearing.
she can't be believed, period. Hallucinating, what was she on? Urban legend, another idiot who just wants attention.
Hey...Anythings possible about this tragedy. Know one should be "name calling" or making negative remarks regarding this incident. Because quite frankly ANYTHING rational such as this woman's reported sighting. Should be considered "fair game" so to speak. And also "potentially possible" as far as leads go. In helping the government and the families of those they lost finally put closure to this awful albeit strange disaster.
How much more stupid can this be? does anyone expect us to believe this lady with this #$%$ story? Supposedly you see something dramatic like this and you think you are hallucinating and do not even bother to report it while knowing that there is a missing plane in the same ocean somewhere(supposedly). Lady, I imagine your whole sailing trip is a hallucination too or you were on drugs. You already lost your 15 minutes of fame by keeping silent like an idiot if what you saw is true. What about the husband? was he hallucinating too?
Well......................no one believed famous fur trapper, Jim Bridger, when he returned to the east from the western frontier, and he told them about finding Yellowstone - in the 1800's. He was known to be a liar, so they didn't believe him this time either, but this time he WAS telling them the truth. And it's been so long historically - that many in the secular world - refuse to believe the Bible is true, or that God exists.....................yet TONS of evidences and proofs provide the truth about both the Bible and that God does exist.
She doesn't need a little more confidence she needs a little more Jack Daniels.
So the plane got shot down by two Japanese Zeros?
no it was taken down by tractor beam get it strait lol
I saw ma 370 being escorted to uncle martins house! once there Tim Probed all the passengers looking for lucie,s lost pearls then the passengers were told to get lost in space and please don't eat the daisey,s or you will upset nanny and the professor, not the real professor he is lost with minnow and its crew but to be careful as you walk thru the ponderosa you could get hit by my mother the car or even shot by lucus tanner, unless you ride with the brady bunch than danny bonaducie and the partridge family should be right behind you unless stopped by sgt Schultz and klinck says set them free in the twilight zone, and they saw the hand of thriller who was don kirshners right hand man from uncle on a mission imposible or was this a jimmy olson dream and mr kent and miss lane stumbled past major healy while eating pip chicks and gen Shaffer was fondeling Jeanie at 13 13 mocking bird hights where ralph cranden and lilly munster we siting in the back seat of car 54 waiting for speeds brother racer x who was coming in fro hooterville on the petty coat junction. rowin and martin were laugh n
Well that at last solves the much-earlier mystery of what happened to the Woodstock Generation.
I'm sure she saw it, but did she have the decency to pull Elvis out of the ocean when he jumped from the plane.
good one !!! We all know Elvis is alive and well........
Thanks for the insightful story. What a joke.
If the woman couldn't believe her eyes for days after she saw it, why would she believe her imagination later? Wack job.
This woman's so full of BS her eyes are probably brown. I'm surprised the Daily Caller would even dignify her insane story by printing it!
What she was doing for the last 3 months with the information?
It's possible, but seems pretty highly unlikely. An aircraft burning that badly would not stay aloft very long. To leave a long trail of flame, you'd almost certainly have to be burning up the on-board jet fuel rapidly. If nothing else, the consumption of the fuel supply would have brought it down fairly quickly. If the fire is related to the deviation from it's planned flight path, it would have had to have been burning for hours to get there. It also doesn't explain the radical path flow.
How about fighter aircraft..Would that be bringing it down fast enough and screw the fuel idea. You don't need fuel to crash after being shot down. (By whom)?
I had a few drinks last night and low and behold I saw a pink elephant sitting in the corner!
i wasnt sitting in the corner dummy, i was in the corner of the sofa!
She also said it was being piloted by Elvis!
Sounds to me like the media is trying to put closure to this story. It's ridiculous and stinks like a cover up. Buy why? That's the question. The video is using animation to put an image into people's minds, and it's not even a sail boat, but some kind of a yacht!
Looks like someone's craving a little attention.
Malaysia Flt. MB370 was carrying 450lbs. of unstable lithium batteries. Most airline companies won’t transport lithium batteries due to instability factors. There have been fatal airline crashes where lithium fumes have lead to explosions and fires. If lithium fumes ignited in the cargo hold and spread to the cabin, it would have been virtually impossible to extinguish this type of fire because onboard flame retardants are not effective against lithium induced combustion. Also, an onboard fire would explain the loss of all communication including cell phones, in part because everyone would have been rendered unconscious.
why were the tracking devices turned off by hand?
why wasn't there a mayday call?
why didnt i wipe my #$%$ after pooing?
One single person out of all the people on this planet claims to have seen the missing plane and it becomes a news story? Must be desperate for a story.
Reading all of these supportive comments, I honestly can't understand why anyone would be reluctant to come forward with something like this. -_-
She thinks it's more likely she's going insane than she's seeing a meteorite? She's got issues.
It's June and she saw this in March? After months and months of media coverage you would think she would say something earlier. It was her and her husband on the boat. Did he see it too?
I saw it the other evening while picking blue berries in my back yard, They were flying low, and in reverse. the passengers waved but did not appear alarmed
This Account requires the lying detector. Otherwise, were wasting our time trying to expose flaws in her alleged anecdote. In spite of her alluring story, we must remember how deceitful people can be for the sake of fame, recognition, etc..... In fact, who's to say this isn't a hoax or that this stranger has integrity. My point is, we can't simply accept this assertion without any strong dependence of her word. Therefore, I won't give her the benefit of the doubt.
good thing you aren't running the show.....................
The 'lying detector' huh? That's a good one.
Yeah you and so many other negative people believe the worst in people before you know the facts.
the sounds maybe like he's/she's Indian, the way the post is written. Charming. :D
@the...your point is that we don't believe a word you say. What the hell is a lying detector? I've heard of a lie detector but never a lying detector. So for everyone's sake on here, Please do not post again. Your drivel is nothing we want to read.
First of All, No Cigarette Boat has enough Fuel to Travel that Far. Next Lie please.
I've said this 100 times at least. The plane was abducted by a UFO from another world. It will never be found because it's on another planet right now. Any one that doesn't believe in other worlds besides ours is completely stupid. I don't know why they wanted this plane but they must have their reasons. The day is coming that we will be at war with another world, and we will not be the winners either. So enjoy your lives now because it will all be over soon.
This womans story wreaks of "I dont want to get involved". Your theory wreaks of too many drugs...
bristle is so wrong, we dont want a war with earth, i mean the aliens dont, ooops
Interesting. She puts the plan on the wrong side of the peninsula. The plane was going from Malaysia to China over the Gulf of Thailand. She puts the plane in either the Malacca Strait or Andaman Sea. So the searchers have been looking in the wrong place the whole time. If she's correct.
B.S. this woman is seeking some attention.
Welcome to another episode of The Ping.
She's funny and candid and appears quite normal because discounting stuff if what most people do. Many many years ago, I saw what was later identified as a Russian satellite burning up during re-entry, and deposited debris way out into the Pacific as planned. There, walking along with a friend in the dead of night, I looked up not remembering why. And there was something flying across the sky, on fire leaving a trail behind it though it was almost too dark to tell. However, it was really sort of anti-climatic and I went about my business.
The other two objects were actually alien ships.
Attention Seeker Alert: I don't buy her story
Stop The Presses!! I found a piece of Aluminum, or something, in my back yard. Get a News Crew here quick, it 'could' be from the Plane. I personally am sick and tired of the Breaking News of Speculation from lumber, trees and lord knows what else floating around. Gotta love the liberals claiming 'Alien Abduction'. I miss the good 'ole days when they'd keep the whole stupid to themselves.
Look who "broke" this story. This is just Tucker Carlson desperately trying to be relevant so he can sell ads and continue the masquerade that he is a legitimate news source.
I want this mystery solved as much as the next person, but I'm sorry I have trouble believing this "account". Could the plane have been shot down? Sure, but did this woman see it? I doubt it. Someone just wanted to get the dust swirling again IMO.
So she saw it and didn't take any video of it. That is interesting.
On fire but there were orange lights with black smoke behind it. How did she know what direction something in the ocean was heading ? Was it sailing along also ? Thought she was hallucinating, but didn't take the time to just cruise on over and see ? Did they chart any longitude/latitude ?
Did I forget to say that I saw the plane go down. It was trailing bright yellow streamers and was piloted by space aliens. A flying saucer hovered above and then sped off. I figured it was probably a weather balloon.
the weather balloon, was here searching for the balloon that crashed in roswell in 1947
Now all the loonies will start coming out of the woodwork with their far out grandiose stories of possible sightings!! She thought she was hallucinating??? Wonder what she was smoking, drinking, or inhaling?? Why no comments from her husband??
Sounds strange to me, why did she wait two months to suddenly report this. I think she was hallucinating!!! However, maybe a search as to where she may have seen something may be worth the look.
Provided she took down the coordinates. If she had, she wouldn't be so crazy!
One never knows. If the plane was shot down in the Indian Ocean, it remains to be seen just exactly where. They've been searching in the wrong areas so far, hopefully, when and if the new search starts, maybe they'll find it.
I don't believe it. Too many apologetic self references against her sanity, plus no recorded proof. With billions of people out there, chances are there's one with their head in the clouds.
There are so many stories out there... I just read a story from Germany yesterday that on the plane were 20 owner of a patent for injected ID chip cards. The patent was applied for in December and was to be finalized March 12, just 4 days after the plane disappeared. The other part of the ownership of this patent would be an American company which name I forgot. When the patent was finalized, in March, it went 100% to the American company. But why would they finalize the patent if the death is not proven? There was another comment about that the plane flew considerately above an American military check point ... mhhh...so many stories...we maybe will never find out.
Lost Malaysian Air Flight or not, plane or not, hallucination or not, true or lie, this woman reads like a self-centered nutcase.
Really hard to believe this lady story, I think everyone in the world knows about the strange disappearance of flight MH370, but this lady waited months to relay her story! No I am not buying it.
That's what we needed at this point: A gaga delusional person capturing the cameras, bathing in the fame, feeding conspiracy theories. More likely, she heard about the plane, realized she was in the area, and then thought about how she could get in on it.
The boat animation is ridiculous. It was an oceangoing sailboat, not a small powerboat. So why should we believe the animation of the airplane is any more accurate?
not likely because there was no indication that plane was on fire when it was going down and something like that actually confuses people more, because if it was a technical problem it makes even less sense they didn't radio out for help.
“Will this help the authorities of the families get closure? I have no idea … but I chose to sweep it under the carpet and now I feel really bad,” she said. ”Maybe I should have had a little more confidence in myself. I am sorry I didn’t take action sooner-WHAT KIND of MORON is this?
how nice this person is just now coming out with this information. I guess she decided she wanted a book deal or maybe just wanted her 15 minutes of fame.... unless she had some film footage or some other credible documentation, I wouldn't care what she had to say.
this story matches the description of a ball of flames from the fishermen, sounds logical to me! Why couldn't it be true?? no-one else has the answer, and here we are months later with still no plane or any evidence at all!
Like all such claims, it needs to be checked out. Like all such claims, it'll probably turn out to be nothing, or an attempt to get attention. Unfortunately, you don't know until you check it out.
Honestly, I found Bigfoot, but I forgot to bring my camera to take pictures. Come on! Why is this on Yahoo?
Who here has ever seen something, thought it odd or out of the ordinary, then immediately deduced (seriously) "I'm going insane?" Wouldn't you have already had some reason to believe that you were senile-bound? I mean really, thinking you're going crazy isn't something that happens as a result of one event. Given that, how much credibility do you hang on the story of a person who has been self-diagnosed as nuts?
"To get back to the warning that I received. You may take it with however many grains of salt that you wish. That the brown kelp that is circulating around the Indian Ocean isn't too good. It is suggested that you stay away from that. Of course it's your own trip. So be my guest, but please be advised that there is a warning on that one, ok?"
The Alcohol and Drugs wore off and she slightly remembers something big in her past , Then she found her vibrator on the floor.
So sent more ship and plane to the ocean between India and Thailand !!! Quick, anyone see any plane going down between India and Africa?
Guess she could`nt (sell) her Story to the National Inquirer so (now) she`s coming forward. Either a publicity seeker, an alcoholic, or both. Just go away.
Well, this news is pretty much irrelevant at this point given the fact that the signal beacon had ceased to emanate sounds long ago and the prevailing currents moved the wreckage far from the original crash site before it disappeared in the ocean depths.
And when I was in Oz I saw The Lucky Charms Leprechaun riding on a unicorn with Santa and The Easter Bunny. They were going to visit The Tooth Fairy and Strawberry Shortcake. They asked me if I wanted to come along, but I was too busy mending the wing of my Flying Pig.
I love the LOST tv show ... nice to see that it now is reality and not fiction.
Oh my God, who paid this Tee twit to actually go public with that ludicrous story! LMFAO
This really makes me think that the air forces of one of the smaller nations in the region inadvertently shot this plane down and are now trying to cover it up.
Obviously she withheld the part about the plane being piloted by Elvis.
Uh-oh. Let the conspiracy fever begin. She may well have seen the plane, but as to seeing the navigation lights of other aircraft, eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable. Seeing something like that at night, from a moving boat, an event that lasts only a few seconds, make it extremely possible she misconstrued what she took for other aircraft. It is certainly worth a search in the area.
Katherine, you were alone on your boat in the middle of the ocean so no one else can verify your story, you obviously can not handle what you're smoking or sniffing.
In the video she doesn't even look like a real person. And I'm not going to take a computer animation's word for anything.
Did Malaysia shoot down their own plane?
The woman is a pallet short of a full load, and idiotic to boot.
Rothschild got even richer when that plane crashed. Nobody looks into stuff.
UFO took the plane. The little green man share meals with chinese and white fellow passengers.
maybe aliens like chinese food? anyone think of that. so they abducted cooks?
I also agree with many others that the Malaysian Gov't has kept important info about this plane secret. They know much more that they have told the public and families. . The plane may have been accidently shot down, or god only knows what happened. What is knows is for some reason Malaysia wants the world to keep guessing what happened, yet they know what happened.
Well, it's just a way to stir up the world's attentions to the missing plane. The focus on the plane has been died down dramatically; now someone tried to make some noise...Believe me, next time there will be some guys saying that they saw the plane landed in the water and slowly sank to the bottom of the ocean...
I thought I almost saw the plane flying low over the Pacific between L.A. and Catalina but then decided it was probably just another flying fish. Now I'm wondering if I should have reported it?
If she's telling the truth, that means the government knows what happened. If she's lying, I still think the government knows what happened.
She shouldn't feel badly at all she didn't really understand what she was seeing because it was very dark. She came forward now and that is what is so important and I am sure this will help investigators and thank GOD she did the right thing and told others the right thing as far as what she saw.
Her statements imply that she is a loon. No wonder eyewitnesses are not usually the best evidence of what actually happened.
This must be a delayed reaction kind of crazy incident.
Shortly after the plane's disappearance there was a fisherman that said the same thing - that he saw what he thought was a plane on fire in that area - they just blew him off
I guess you have not heard all the other fish stories.
this #$%$ is whacky....why is anyone even talking about her??????/hello???????????
Forget: Professionals know a lot about one thing and nothing about anything else. We have listened to ALL the professionals and they know exactly where the plane is. How it crashed and who is to blame. If you see a kid getting beaten or a dog abused I am sure you call the authorities because you are so upstanding. Most people turn away because they don't want to get involved. Leave it to the professionals so to say!
She also saw a tiger and an Indian guy on board.
I've believed that plane was shot down since the incident happened. Someone is covering something up.
If in fact it was shot down there would be debris floating in the ocean.
If she were legitimate, she would have come forward at the time. Claiming she waited three months because she couldn't believe her eyes is #$%$.
Some good comments here, but there are a lot of questions not answered. Sad that so many find glory in making jokes at the expense of hundreds of missing or dead people. The plane IS still missing, so ANY news could be valuable and must be investigated and proven true or not true. As fishy as this seems, what if it did provide a missing link? 1) What were the coordinates of her boat at the time and 2) what time of night did this happen? She says her husband was on the boat, but there is not a word or comment from him in the story. 3) Was he the pilot and 4) what if anything did he see? 5) Surely if it is as she says, she would have alerted her husband to such a scene, or was he under the influence or maybe not even her husband. 6) How long did she observe the plane and 7) was it at low altitude, middle latitude or high altitude? 8) What direction did the plane seem to be heading? 9) Did the plane seem to be losing altitude and 10) did she see it possibly go down? Depending on its altitude she could have seen it for a long time or a short time Seeing such a site, plane or not, one would not turn away from such a scene or tell her "husband" unless she was under the influence. 11) She was British, so 12) how could she miss the news that was on every day for several months? 13) When she finally realized she might have seen THE missing plane (after "checking" the flight plan of the plane), why call a tabloid rather than a legitimate source, like the FAA, or FBI, or even her local police department or local legitimate newspaper? This is one of the more damaging aspects to her "sighting" and reporting. Did she tell any other friends? 14) Since her report has become public, is there an official agency questioning her authenticity and facts, or is she a known nut case? Some of the commenters seem to know where the plane (object) and her boat may have intersected. 15) Knowing the direction and approximate speed, would this warrant a search of a new area, if not already done? 16) Then there is the question of the two mysterious planes above it going the opposite direction. Seeing these two planes above the plane on fire, and noticing their flashing navigation lights, the plane on fire was not at very high altitude. 17) Also, seeing the two planes apparently flying close together (very unusual) did they appear to be smaller fighter jets? 18) If they fired at this plane from a distance, which would be very likely, they could have been passing overhead with their target on fire. 19) Whose air space would the plane on fire been in around this time? Even is they did not fire at the plane and its fire started from the batteries, as some commenters surmise, knocking out its ability to communicate with the "jets", these jets may have documented their sighting to their air tower. 20) If we knew the air space, we could pressure that country about this "sighting." 21) If they did fire a rocket at it and set it ablaze because it did not answer or change course to their warnings of being shot down because it was an unknown aircraft in their air space, it would be very unlikely we will hear the truth, unless we find the wreckage and black box. If we don't hear any more on this case, she must have been determined a nut case.
Good comments?? Its a bunch of moronic experts with their theories on a plane crash.
I wonder what kind of tea she really drinks that gives her hallucination. How can someone not tell reality from hallucination.
This story made me think I should have told somebody that I saw Amelia Arhearts plane crash years ago when I was on MY boat. I think I will. Dumb old sea hag!
So what did the HUSBAND report (immediately, by radio)? Was anybody wearing the pants in this marriage?
I saw it in lake Superior, I didn't believe my eyes so I didn't say anything and yes, I often hallucinate, and my Doctor knows I am insane but I want to bring closure to the families.
And she is why witness testimony is usually worthless.
I Think This airplane was hijacked while it was being boarded and all the cellphones were took from the passengers.That would explain why no cell calls were made if there was an explosion or any other emergency aboard that airplane. Katfish
Sounds like some trip and I'm not referring to the boat ride!
Ok, which is it: black smoke (probably not visible at night) or navigation lights (not visible during the day). This story doesn't make any sense.
The writer really does not ask nor disclose what time it was at the supposed time of siting. Was it dusk or late night and dark. Was there a full moon or no moon light at all? This "article" really leaves more questions than it does answers.
She might not have believed her eyes at the time, but how the next day when the plane was reported missing? Not that authorities would have done anything.
Was there a navigational reading to check the spot they were when she saw this?
Too bad a sighting comes from such a non credible source. She completely undermines herself with all the looney talk.
She has just as much credibility as everyone else involved because everyone including the 'experts' know jack squat about what happened to it.
Maybe she saw the P-3 Orion search lights and they usually have black smoke following them. The other aircraft could have been search aircraft too. Wouldn't the pilot try and ditch the aircraft if it was on fire and not near a suitable landing site?
It's the location, the time and proof they were sailing in that area first then credibility. She must realize she could be in big trouble for offering a tale which can easily be disproven if it is false. Her story indicates sabotage which explains more than driving the plane until it runs out of fuel. That just doesn't ring well with most people. An explosion, a fire and a decending aircraft is more like it.
OH! I Thought it might be some other plane on fire, Or Aliens, Yeah That's it Aliens!
Just get Tattoo, he always know where the plane is. 239 cell phones on that plane , and no one called anyone !!! If its in the indian ocean, it will take years to find , look how long it took to find the Titanic.
Good analogy ... they had a pretty good fix on the Titanic when it sunk. They don't have a good fix on the location of this plane when it went down at all! I have serious doubts that it will ever be found.
Really, can we please say BS.
I call b.s., sounds made up as if Malaysia was actually giving the report.
I am sure that lots of people see Malaysian airliners fly over the Indian ocean, several times a day, every day of the week. Good try lady, you must have been hallucinating. sorry, no reward.
She saw something, but her default explanation seems to be that she was hallucinating or going insane. Why would that be her most likely explanation? Back into the woodwork she goes.
I slept at a Holiday Inn Express last night.
Yahoo Reader proclaims woman looking for a bit of attention.
#$%$? You saw the plane possibly and didn't say anything till now after all the searching that went on?
This is absolute BS! The sad thing is we have people in the world that will actually believe this woman. It only took her over three months to say something. OMG are people stupid!
Interesting to note that if what she says is true (she saw 2 planes above it) and a trail of black smoke with orange fire and putting that together with the fact that the plane immediately veered off its intended course after takeoff with the transponders turned off, I wonder if the Malaysian government dispatched two fighter jets to bring it down since they realized it was a hijacking/pilot suicide situation. One will never know the truth on that one as the plane continued its flight for 4 hours after takeoff veering completely off course and thus maybe the Malaysian government did not want to take the chance of it being a terrorist attack similar to 9/11. Just a thought...
easy, Dave... easy... with drinking the kool-aid
Why would the plane continue its flight for 4 hours without communication from the pilots after the pilots completely veered off course. It's possible that the Malaysian government did not know their intended destination and thus the intention of the pilots. Why else would it keep flying for 4 hours unless the plane depressurized which incapacitated the pilot per the golfer whose name I forget. At Flight Level 300 (30,000) the time of useful consciousness is less than 5 seconds for the pilots to put their oxygen masks on. However, the pilots immediately turned off the transponder at an altitude of only 3000 feet where no pressurization is needed. You can fly up to 12,000 with no problem and stay there indefinitely! Meaning: It was deliberate action by the pilots or whoever was commanding them (terrorists)
If the Malaysian military had fighter jets that might work.
how many times have I commented that story. once again I believe that the plane was shot down by some country because they did not recognize the plane and it off course. That is what we did during 911.that is why we are looking in the wrong place for the plane. It is a cover up. They do not want to find this plane. We will when the us take over the investigation. They should form their own investigation because we had Americans on board. America really need to know what happen because we don't want another 911. We really take things to lightly.
That's funny that you should say that Malaysia has no fighter jets. If you google Malaysia fighter jet, you will find that they own FA18 hornets, Sukhoy 27 and lots lots more.
why should we pay for that investigation? aren't we broke enough?....
The name of the golfer whose plane depressurized and continued its flight for 4 hours before crashing was Payne Stewart. However, this is not the case here as the transponders were turned off at an altitude of 3000 feet, well below the altitude where cabin pressure is WITH pressurization which is 8000 feet while flying at flight level 400 (40,000 feet). This means the pilots did this DELIBERATELY. The only question remains is whether someone was holding a gun to their head.
how do they know it kept flying another 4-hours dave ?
don't know what is wrong with the blog today it will let me give thumbs down but not thumbs up which i was trying to give to David
they have automated transponded info from the engines (or something like that)
its a flight path geeesh..between 2 dozen countries..good grief
One day I was so drunk I thought my dog was talking to me. Then it dawnd on me I also had the television on. It was Brian of Family Guy.
Some people are just plain evil. Those who enable them are equally evil.
I just don't get it... what is it with the British self-denial and paralyzing fear of ostracization ... after all these centuries, you think they'd get over it. I was in London a few years ago... beautiful city, BTW... but all the women pulling around rolling luggage, guys in skinny jeans or short/tight suits... well, same language, different culture. A mentality that is 50 to 100 years behind the times, but in a modern setting. It was surreal. Maybe I was hallucinating? Oh, and off-topic, it's absolutely true, the food is SO BLAND.
The odd part is the plane never signaled a fire before it stopped communication. That's why they think it became a ghost ship and flew for hours on autopilot. They also think the cabin lost pressure and everyone passed out due to lack of air. Fires don't burn well without air. The last odd thing is she saw other planes "above?" it ? The plane was very far up at cruising altitude where the air is thin at last communication, not low to sea level.
It's low at sea level right before it crashes Einstien.
ValueJet 592 burned quite well at altitude.
@Zues There's a helluva lot of air (oxygen) just outside the plane.
The lack of air DENSITY at high altitude is more than made up for by the air VELOCITY if there was a structural failure of the fuselage skin, allowing air to enter. If the people had already been incapacitated by then, they most likely would have remained so. A jet engine operates at high altitudes where the air is very thin, remember.
It has been months since the flight first went missing. This woman could just be trying to get attention. Even on the off chance that she did see the flight go down, there really is no forgivable reason that she did not come forward. It is human nature to be curious about the out of the ordinary, and if for no other reason she would have reported the incident out of curiosity and the worry of lost lives.
Fire doesn't burn well at altitude…well then how do you think a jet engine works ? with electricity?
They flew low to avoid detection. something malicious happened. this wasnt an accident
fire can burn where there is not enough oxygen to support life. Naphtha being an exception. That is why it is used in safety lanterns aboard ships.
I saw the missing Malaysian jet in a potato chip right next to Jesus and the Virgin Mary.
Wow, what an idiot! Sounds more like those 2 planes shot this plane down!
There's something extremely fishy about this whole story - there is obviously a massive cover-up of whatever really happened. Don't be fooled, people - our governments have satellites in space that can read your license plate as you drive down the street! We're supposed to believe that a plane that goes missing would not be tracked by satellite?
Don't forget, we can use radio controlled robots on Mars from here and they can beam back pictures of sand and some kind of lifeform from there. So obviously they know what happened
This is from a woman who hasn't seen her own #$%$ is years.
From the 1st day it was mentioned, I have suspected this plane was shot down, either by mistake, or for flying over restricted space. It has not been made public since it would cause panic among the millions of people flying on a daily basis and would hurt the Airlines tremendously, not to mention the culprit.
I've got an issue with this statement. Black smoke etc is suggestive of some mishap with the plane. First it goes in a toal different direction and then it gets on fire or something - two abnormalities in the same flight? Come one!
She was right...that she was hallucinating! How could a person who thought saw a meteorite would then tell us that they saw smoke, flame and two planes above in the dark?? And what does the husband has to say about his?
She was sailing from India to Thailand. She looked up the flight plan of MH-380 and found that their paths intersected. India is west of Thailand and the MH-380 flight plan went on the east side of Thailand. Was she taking the scenic route?
Crazy people for publicity. Do not believe.
This will give CNN a week's worth of special reports. By the way, I saw an airplane flying over my house (in Iowa) in early March - do I get my name in a news report too?
It's always good to have a witness who is questioning their own mental state.
I just saw Biggie and Tupac grabbing a bite to eat. I didn't say anything because I thought I was hallucinating but it was definitely them...
She probably didn't report it because she was probably high af and thought she was trippin.
interesting, she didn't believe her eyes so she didn't report it. I don't believe her story so why is it being reported. after the enormous amount of news generated after the plane went missing, anyone with half a mind probably would have reported anything they thought they saw. try again!
Okay, if she thought it more likely that she was "going insane" I'm guessing she might already have some difficulty interpreting reality. The more she thinks about it and imagines she saw the plane, the more she believes it's true. But I think it's more likely that her brain is just reinterpreting her experience based on the news reports.
Does anyone know if she's on CNN yet? If not, Wolf is already hunting for her. Either she needs publicity, or maybe and a big maybe she's telling the truth.
She also saw Bigfoot water skiing being towed by a UFO.
You couldn't see black smoke at night. Your 15 minutes are already over.
Perhaps this insane lady was hallucinating, I mean, she thought that is what it was at the time. Here she was, in the middle of the ocean, what a safe place to drop acid, and then this may have happened ? Bad trip I'm guessing.
Ummmm. I'm going with her first belief about her observation, she was going insane, and obviously hasn't come out it.
The most likely result of the claim is the woman is insane. Just now stepping forward, where has she been all this time, I bet in an insane asylum on mars.
This story appeared yesterday in the Telegraph, a UK newspaper. Also part of the story was a report from an Australian hydrophonic research station that they picked up a sound from the tip of India of a 'sealed air-filled cylinder being crushed by water pressure". Couple this with the suggestion of a photo taken by a satellite of a plane possibly under water in the general area off Southern India, might be worth a look.
I do NOT BELIEVE anything this women said. It is pure BS. You see something like that - you report it immediately. I guess the crazies will keep coming out of the woodwork.
That's why I never sail in the India Ocean.
How much weed and alcohol did she have that night?
Yahoo writers can be a bit annoying at times.
If one thinks they may have seen a burning plane, why would one wait two to three months before saying anything? Especially when that person knows the world is looking for what they say they saw.
If she did see it, why didn't she get on the radio and call the Coast Guard?
Ok is the "authorities" better? Yes, el you can contact "authorities" from anywhere in an emergency.
What do I need a map for? To see how "vast" the indian Ocean is?
I know the ocean is big, but all boats are required to have emergency beacons, a device for distress signals and radios that are made to contact help no matter where you are.
3 months to figure it out on your own? Stick with the initial assessment lady. Your mind was playing tricks on you.
I don't believe one word she said about MH370 the only words she wrote that II believe is that she was hallucinating because most all of those sailing throughout the World ocean are using drugs, why I say this, I live on an Island in the Caribbean and there are very, very few of those people that come ashore that are not looking for Marihuana or some stronger type of drugs, I said very few, men and woman.
I was out mowing in my backyard in central Ohio when it flew over. It was trailing smoke that read: "Surrender Dorothy!" I thought I was hallucinating at the time.
With all the coverge of this event, if she saw something remotely like a plane down, why does she have to wait 3 months to believe her eyes? Sounds like she is hoping for a big reward if she can believe her eyes as to where the plane was .
if this was true she would have reported it during the first week of the plane going missing. The fact that it took her 3 months to come forward with input of no value speaks of an ulterior motive.
Ever heard of Diego Garcia? Fighter Interceptors taking down an intruder. Think about it.
What does her husband think? What did he see? And, perhaps most importantly, what's being taught in journalism schools these days?
Maybe her husband was asleep below deck and saw nothing. Maybe she told him what she saw. Maybe he dismissed her and made her feel unsure about what she had seen. A dynamic I've observed in many couples.
She doesn't remember because she was stoned and orange lights were everywhere.
She should have reported what she saw immediately and documented as much as possible where it was that she saw it. Then let those searching for the plane decide what information to act on.
Malaysian government nor any other government are about to admit to shooting it down themselves, accidentally or otherwise.
They can use her approximate position combined with the two other flights going above to determine very closely where she was. That means they may find the plane.
Talk about an untimely response. I don't know how this can give anyone "closure" beyond what is already in the news. The plane isn't sitting somewhere with 200+ passengers being fed 3 squares a day. Everyone is dead, or the vast majority are.
Back in the day I saw Magic Johnson walking in the old Flamingo. I kept it till myself til now.
In 2003 a plane in Nigeria was hijacked from the ground, and its destiny remains unknown to this day, though the Nigerian military claim that they were ordered by the US navy to shoot it down.
This is just one more theory to add to the heap. The strangest thing to me about this airplane is zero debris, not even anything that looks remotely like debris.
I think your perfectly sane Ms. T. More likely it was that bottle of scotch.
That was probably just aliens. Nothing to be alarmed about. Carry on.
Yea and I saw "Elvis, Tupoac, Buddy Holly and John Lennon all smoking dope in Albuquerque New Mexico last week, I called the Police and they said they would send someone over as soon as they finish with the rigged speed trap - They never showed up, darn it.
It could have been a Chinese drone that shot the plane down. China is spending billions to upgrade their military with drones.
A lot of good this information does us now, if it was true. It would only have been useful shortly after the flight went missing.
I'm sure that with looking at charts and number of day out in the water plus the journey plan that told the intersection of both, a precise if not close, location of the plane can be pinpointed.
Is anybody else thinking, "Well, didn't her HUSBAND see the same thing ??? - and why is there no statement about what the husband saw or didn't see, and if he didn't see anything - why not??" Unless the husband was on DRUGS or SLEEPING or something, then why didn't he CORROBORATE her story with a statement to the same source the wife made her 'observation' too?!!!!!
MH370, Rothschild, Semi-conductor patent worth billions is all you need to know about what happened to the people and the plane. Don't shoot the messenger
First we have to check if she smokes anything...
Have you seen The Langoliers by Stephen King? Horrible movie, but the whole idea of the plane disappearing is kinda like that. BTW, I love how everyone is an expert about aerial navigation and the theories of what happened to the plane. You'd figure it would be found already with so many experts in this group. Long story short, Ancient Aliens were involved.
Would make sense that the plane was shot down by the other planes for some reason and that the offending government would cover it up.
And another loony claims their 15 minutes of fame.
Basically implying the plane may have been shot down by the other two planes and then the disappearance was covered up.
Maybe she was running drugs on her boat and didn't call authorities for fear of being caught.
Why is anyone even bothering to give this any serious coverage? Nothing this woman says makes any sense.
Another woman saw it in a laundromat in Memphis.
I know one thing. There are no shortage of lunatics on the World Wide Web.
I saw it in the end zone of a NJ football stadium.
I saw the missing Malaysian air flight in Hollywood last week. Didn't think to mention it.
I hope she noted her coordinates at the time.
Oh hey, did I tell you I saw the guy on the grassy knoll? Yeah, I waited because I wanted to be sure. Anyway, I'm offering a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge.
I saw the missing plane too please come and interview me so I can get my 1 minute fame.
Look I pushed the issue on re-examining satellite images for a,space time rift wormhole like situation very common over in the Bermuda area I'm told by Asian's over there that they have their own triangle situation going on, literally a day after I pressured elements in D.C. The sudden break out over who just had the anwar sat data and THEN the u.s. Navy's own report that the pings never were the pings of a plane therefore the plan is GONE god rest in peace of the passengers NO u.s. official experiments exist that tell us what happens to people that get sucked into the erratic wormhole however I,will say if it's a time distortion and they are thrown out,of,time or into a parallel earth situation they are alive and safe but will never find away back a miracle of all miracles could have happened where they were flipped into the far future they have draconian rules about timeline interference . However our future consists of a hybrid race collective a by-product of successful medical cross bridging or transitioning of autistic people considered very smart yet at this moment in time not truly matriculated into global society however smart AI technology and this technology produces successful DNA customization of medication tailored to the autistic children thus successful functional personalities will also create a surge of childbirth translation a NEW human sequenced hybrid race raising our class status home-world to a higher more advanced world this could cause a severe culture shock especially IF they discover China as THEY knew it was no more all changed due to flooding and sink hole problems possibly war as well.
What? Take off the tin foil hat, use some proper punctuation, and try typing that again so it is comprehensible.
this woman is either a LIAR or an IDIOT. This plane thing dominated the news all the time since its disappearance and I find it funny she is just now coming forward.
I always wondered if Malaysia shot it down and has been covering it up. Whether it was accidental or on purpose they sure wouldn't want the world to know.
Why is everything about the disappearance of this plane bizarre? It could't have been written any better even if it were a movie.
Im thinking it's in some hanger on land getting prepped for a serious evil deed in the future. If it went into the sea there should be some debris somewhere and none has been found as yet.
You do too much acid at sea and when something really happens, you are just not quite sure.
If she believes what she saw, its likely the larger plane could have been shot down by two smaller fighter jets from a yet undetermined origin which may explain no report from the two smaller planes realizing a mistake of taking out a defenseless passenger plane.
I once saw Sasquatch. Or I was hallucinating.
i see him every dang day
The question is, where is the plane at? How does a plane just vanish into thin air. With today's technology you would think we could find it. Unless the Malaysia airlines are withholding critical information.
Not necessarily. If it went down in the water, we may never find it. Look how long it took to find that Air France flight that went down off of S. America (2 years), and they knew where to look.
So if this #$%$ claimed she saw it, how come satelite haven't been able to go back and back track coverage at that time? Why hasn't there been any kind of debris?Whatever crack she was on, she better quit.
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Well, that pretty tells you everything you need to know about this woman. She didn't believe her eyes, she thought it could have been a meteorite, she didn't say anything until now, and she thought it was more likely that she was going insane. Need she say more? I think she's full of hot gas. What do you think?
When possible answers to a problem become extremely complex - as many theories flying about to determine what happen to MH-370 – in the end the simplest answer turns out to be the correct answer. Plain and simple – this plane crashed in the Indian Ocean because of faulty plane. However, just like in our time period we solved the answer for Amelia Earheart and other mysteries as well, this mystery won’t be solved until the year 3075 when the people of that time period will find the plane and reveal the plane simply crashed due to faulty plane product, then wonder how people in our time period conjured up so many answers – such as US military shooting it down – were nothing but silly mind games.
Another #$%$ story by somebody looking for their 14 minutes. She saw smoke at night trailing from the plane???
Possibly a futile attempt by authorities to make people believe the jet went a certain way. There has been NO evidence of what they claim.
It's amazing to me that no one can find the missing plane but we can find planets light years away.
B.S-SHE WAITS UNTIL NOW TO COME OUT. EVERYONE WANTS TO GET INTO THE ACT THESE DAY. AM FOLLOWING THE LATEST JOKE REGARDING THE LATEST ACTIONS TO FIND THAT PLANE. WHY WOULDN'T MALAYSIA JUST ADMIT THAT 250MILLION DOLLAR AIRCRAFT WAS STOLEN AND SOLD. THE PASSENGERS ARE DEAD-WHO EVER WAS INVOLVED GOT THEIR CUT OF THE DEAL. THE PLANE HAS MOST LIKELY BEEN USED FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND POSSIBLY HAS ALREADY BEEN STRIP[PED WITH THE PART SOLD. IF THERE WERE 8 INVOLVED IN THIS 'PRE-PLANNED HEIST' EACH GOT, LET'S SAY, 7MILLION: MEANING THE PLANE WAS SOLD FOR 54 MILLION. THE GANG ALL KNEW EACH OTHER-FAMILY-PAST MILITARY EXPERIENCE-FLYING EXPERIENCE. THE CAPTAIN AND POSSIBLY CO PILOT WERE IN ON IT: OR JUST POSSIBLY ONE OF THEM. MALAYSIA IS A CROP OF BS, AND THE WHOLE NEWS COVERAGE HAS BEEN A JOKE. NO F$%#@&& WAY THAT PLANE IS UNDER WATER-AND THEY KNOW IT. AM STILL CURIOUS ABOUT THIS RICHARD, SOMETHING OR OTHER, THAT HAS A BRIT ACCENT AND WAS ON THE PANEL FOR cnn's-"Guess where the big birdy went". There as pix of him and the co-pilot. Hmmmm-just curious-not saying anything.
She might have seen MH370 but I hope they give her a complete psych exam and lie detector test before spending another billion or two searching.
I sincerely hope this is true and she isn't just a publicity seeker.
I saw a flying hippo once, really. At first I thought I was hallucinating but now I know I wasn`t.
Perhaps they should have waited another 6-12 months before coming up with this story!
I believe that was the plane but why would she come forward now. Even if her and her husband didn't have any access to internet or phone as soon as you get to land make the calls and report it...
This woman makes no sense at all. The world was searching for this plane since it disappeared months ago. She simply needed to speak up. What an idiot.
How would you have liked to be the woman's husband stuck in the middle of the ocean with her - my prayers go out to him..
Pictures or it didn't happen Katherine, pictures.
Strange & almost laughable that the Brit woman KatT woke up one day after 2 mos to report she has the epiphany of the missing Malaysian aircraft. She won't get even a 5' of fame.
She at least deserves a high five.
I saw Elvis getting into a limo and thought I was hallucinating. Let's face facts folks she didn't see the plane and if they really wanted to find this plane they would follow the money trail. Investigate anyone who had something to gain from that plane going missing like the Malaysian government and airline owners and you'll find that plane.
I saw a passenger flight on fire and I am just now coming forward... hmmmm
Really??? All of a sudden it just came to you months after the incident and you though, hey... maybe I should say something. Get a life lady. If anyone is going to be famous out of this incident it would have been you THREE MONTHS AGO, or the person that finds the wreckage and victims from here on out.
Finally. A story I can comment on. Ok, someone answer me this. Why are the authorities searching 4000 miles south of where the plane was last seen on radar? It did not turn around, based on other articles I have read and flight path diagrams I have seen, so why are they searching by Australia?? They need to get their #$%$ together. I could find this fuxking plane. If i was going to coordinate a search, I would conduct a perpendicular line from where the plane was last seen and search upwords. Not down. These people are just prolonging the search. Idiots.
They are searching there because some government DOES NOT want them to find the plane and figure out what really happened. 10 to 1 it had a battery fire, especially after they finished releasing the belly contents and said hit had a #$%$ load of lithium batteries on it. Could her statement be true? No more wrong that any of the others who have screwed the pooch on this one!!! Leave her alone BillJ and LaunchPad, unless YOU can really prove her wrong. I've got NO IDEA who she is, and really care less, but I can tell you from first hand knowledge, governments tell you what they want you to believe, then they build the story around the lie to mislead everyone. WAKE UP and look at the administration in power of the US. LIE, LIE, and more lies. Look at this weeks lie, Sec. State says "we had to get him because he is so sick" or something to that effect, then on another tv channel she says he is really good health. Some miracle happened and he was healed in two hours. LIE,LIE, and LIE some more!!! Welcome to the GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED LIFE, and if the one's in power don't change, IT IS GOING TO GET LOTS WORSE.
still say it's on dry land some where
When the plane was last seen on military radar, it had turned almost completely around. It was heading north towards it's intended destination in China and when it was last seen on military radar it was heading south by southwest. If, the plane continued in a straight line, it would have ran out of fuel over the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean is directly west of Australia, so that is why the investigators are looking for the plane there. There is a lot of airline traffic going east and west between India and Vietnam, but it wasn't spotted by other jet airliners in that area; therefore, it is believed the plane continued flying south/southwest, until it ran out of fuel. It had enough fuel to fly for 7 and a half hours.
Now that British woman Margaret Tee has reported seeing a plane on fire 3 months in the Indian Ocean we can put this one bed.
She also claims knowing the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa.
This is such a Fabricated Story... What a JOKE.
Yea, you would think she would be on it stat!! Or soon after! The whole world was up in arms about this so if she felt awkard or not it wouldnot have matter. Mamma Mia!
Add this to the list of plausible (and highly implausible) sounding eyewitness reports... I wonder if this one would square with the oil rig worker who saw a burning flame go down into the water? I'll have to admit that the Doppler data seemed a little fuzzy. Maybe they should have been looking closer to Malaysia?
Did you get attention you wanted? If this was so you would have said something... Full of it!!
Burning cargo with dysfunctional avionics and a crew frantically trying to return home?
I was surfing at my secret Surf spot on some little island in the Indian Ocean when I saw this Malaysian Airline fly low over my head and it went down about a mile out. This was around March 8th. I didn't come forward because I wanted to keep my favorite Surf spot a secret. Besides nobody would have survived that crash anyway.
Wish there would have been more coverage in the media for this tragedy so she would have known she needed to come forward sooner! Whatever! Either she's a liar or she lives under a rock!
REALLY!!!! So to what extreme will people go to get attention, maybe an interview on TV get paid Lots of money for this Cockamamie bunch of made up #$%$!!! Ya know come to think of it I might of seen it out in the middle of lake Michigan but I wasn't sure cause with the sun, and reflection and the purple dragons tail sticking out, but it might of just been "Puff" out there floating around. Get Real People is everyone that starved for attention that we try to believe this.!!! Wow!
A sane person! What a relief!
strange representation, a yacht without sails and keeping watch from a recliner. If she's correct about what she saw, it sounds like it was shot down, but way north (and close to a lot of aggressive and secretive countries) of where the main search has taken place.
Did not believe her eyes at the time? Great reporting there. What a dumb a__!
And another nut ball! I wish they would find the plane however to bring closure for the families.
Yeah lady, I also think you were hallucinating.
I was in Kansas at the time and I am positive I saw it flying overhead with Obama hanging out the back yelling "more taxes, more taxes " everyone must pay more in taxes because Mooshelle needs another multi million dollar vacation and I need to get her away from me. So Obama was yelling more taxes and this plane was barely staying up in the air.
taxes have never been lower-thank you Mr Obama and thanks for not taking as many vacations as the last republican President
Even the school children in that sinking ship took camera phone videos. I believe that these people were taken hostage, Their cellphones confiscated, and the plane was shot down when it flew into a restricted airspace without proper authorization.
Is this her 15-minutes of fame---she comes out with a story how many months later? Not believable.
You see a lot of weird stuff out on the ocean. I knew they were hallucinations so I just sat back and enjoyed the show.
All these anicdotal "oberservations" and speculations are meaningless. The black boxes are gone, every promising lead has been extinguished, and the ocean is a big, dark, deep place. It took over 70years to discover Titanic. It could take longer, if ever, to find Flight MH370.
Truth can be stranger than fiction. Like so many snipets of stories posted on Yahoo, this is a tickler, and there isn't enough information here to draw any conclusions about anything. Hopefully the actual information she provides will somehow help narrow the search for the missing airplane.
Hallucinations. Did she see Elvis sitting on the wing?
I can't believe they posted a picture of a cartoon animation of a boat.
Could've at least put a plane's reflection on the water or something.
Never mind I just realized it was a video. Stupid me.
As someone who has spent many consecutive days at sea on a small boat, I can confirm that you will often hallucinate, especially at night.
After all this time she is just now putting 2 and 2 together that is could have been related? Why didn't she say something sooner? If I had seen what she says she saw I would have told somebody by now!
Ok, so we have a woman who witnessed a plane flying overhead, on fire, and two other planes flying above the one on fire. That about solves it!
Honestly! I think that what really happened is going to remain a Mystery! Which is sad, because so many families need closure.
Whatever she saw - she seems legit to me.
I say codswallop to this story!
Whatever! this whole missing jet story is just a bunch of lies
What lies are you referring to? That it left radar and hasn't been found?
First of all, if she had seen the news when she got home. She should have notified the Authorities immediately...Maybe she was hallucinating
CNN tried to get the lady on the air but she is in a the southern Oregon Cascade Range forest looking for Bigfoot.
Oh, that does bring closure. Because we all thought the people were living in a Gilligan's Island scenario. Now that we know they're all dead...closure.
I was on the boat with them, and we also saw Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and little green aliens. I feel badly that I didn't speak up sooner.
First thing I would do is check her boat for illegal drugs!
w.e.l.l. when somebody "sees" a plane on fire, and feel they are hallucinating, then maybe they are. If I saw a plane on fire, I think I would recognize it as a plane on fire. So also most other people.
Yes, she was hallucinating. She was actually in her bathtub in LA.
She's either a complete flippin idiot or a liar. I think it's the latter.
So did she see it hit the water or completely vaporize? Sort of like her vapor story?
So when is her book coming out or the TV Movie she will probably get credit for ? Damn, I saw a UFO here in Georgia the other night. Ya'll think I could get a movie deal ? wafshame
Yawn, just add it to the list in unconfirmed reports.
Why do all the internet news sources keep showing the shadow of a prop driven search plane on the water as though to suggest it is an image of the lost jet?
She sounds high as a kite and not credible. who says they thought they were going insane? I have seen things where i said that is weird or freaky but I have never doubted my sanity. "I questioned my mind. I was looking at what appeared to be an elongated plane glowing bright orange, with a trail of black smoke behind it. It did occur to me that it might be a meteorite. But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.”
Over time people start convincing themselves that they saw something. The power of suggestion is powerful!
good thing her boat wasn't on fire, Gilligan may have thought it was a freaking coconut!
Hi, I want to be in a worldwide news article so let me make up this story.
What interests me is that she saw two airplanes flying high above. If this plane was shot down, I don't think we are supposed to find it!
My thoughts , exactly! But why would it have been shot down? Unless pirates are trying something new we haven't seen before!
She thought she was hallucinating, because of all the mushrooms. But it was totally a plane on fire, and the fairies and flying squirrels were on fire too.
Wow- for a person "seeing" things she remembers quite a bit... “There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,” she said. “They had normal navigation lights. I remember thinking that if it was a plane on fire that I was seeing, the other aircraft would report it.” Since authorities still haven’t found the plane, Tee feels bad for not saying something sooner.
so, you basically repeated what the article said. some post.
This stupid woman waited almost three months to report a plane ON FIRE!!!? You must be kidding. Seems to me that the next place to search would be the coordinates where this woman saw it burning and crashing, but I'm beginning to agree with some of the others on this forum that there is definitely a cover-up here and it could very well be that the Malaysians shot it down because it was off-course and crossed over their territory with no signal to identify itself. Like many others, I'm convinced the Malaysians don't want the aircraft to be found because then we'll know for sure that they shot it down.
Hey pin head it was a Malaysian air craft.
No need for name-calling, Jimmy. You need to get out of your Mom's basement and learn about the real world. Do you not think that those scrambled fighters on 9/11/2001 would not have shot down one of those hijacked American airplanes if they had gotten the order from the Pentagon? A rocket up the tailpipe of a couple of them would have saved the WTC and that would have happened had they been able to find them first. If the transponders on MH370 were not working, that aircraft could have come from Mars as far as the Malaysian authorities were concerned. To the folks in Kuala Lumpur, MH370 was already inside PRC airspace when the unidentified aircraft entered their airspace because control had already been handed over to Chinese ATC. Fighter pilots generally don't get close enough to their targets to identify them visually before they launch their rockets. Remember, too, that the electrical power on MH370 was apparently gone, so there were no outside lights to identify the aircraft as being Malaysian. Their order to shoot it down came from the ground. The pilots had no discretion in the matter. MH370 was an unidentified large aircraft (a bomber) that was off all known flight routes and heading from the direction of China and over Malaysian territory. What do you think would have been done? Or, it might have been a SAM that brought it down. Whoever would have launched that missile would definitely not have known what he/she was shooting at. You must never have served in the military. I know an nice army recruiter who would love to talk to you this afternoon and a few months in the military would set you straight.
I think she should stick to her initial instinct that she's insane.
She is British, they are always hallucinating... too much warm beer
How do you say "publicity stunt"? This one seems to have worked!
Another tall tale, I think. Later, she'll way it could be a UFO.
Another fishy story involving the ocean. Seriously. Her whole testimony seems fishy....PS: Why didn't they get her husbands perspective? She stated that she didn't come forward immediately because she "ASSUMED" other other two planes would report it....WHAT? How long did it take for her to figure out that the planes DIDN'T report...because the aircraft had been considered LOST since they day it departed. Fishy Fishy
I read of another eyewitness account from I believe was a fisherman seeing a very low flying large aircraft off the coast of Kota Bharu which is on the NE coast of Malaysia. Put these two accounts together and you may have some solid evidence.
After 4-5 Martini's anything is possible.
Was that before or after she was abducted by a UFO?
I want in on this action... I was looking through my high powered telescope looking at planets which just happen to be pointed towards the Indian Ocean that night and i saw flight 370.
I believe she was right the first time; She was hallucinating, Who in their right mind would not report something as important as that?
If this woman saw what she thought to be a plane on fire, I agree it should have been reported and it should be checked out. More importantly, who were the other two planes, where were they from and did they shoot it down?
man these stories have got to feel like knifes in the wounds of family members seeking closure.
With all these claims to those who have seen the Malaysian airliner, it's almost become a laughing joke in my opinion. Next thing you know the media will cover a story on some 12 year old kid who knows where the plane is based on his google satellite.
So if it was on fire between Thailand and Malaysia it wouldn't have flown very far from there. And that area was searched and no debris found and that is a heavily traveled shipping route. Hum once again just doesn't add up.
they are just protesting and refuse to come back until their demands are met.
Let me stop you right there chief, i got a few things for ya' here. Number one, you didnt see any plane on fire in the middle of the indian ocean. Number two, why are you making up lies trying to make headlines, when you KNOW that people are still gettin fired up about this!? Number three, you should be ashamed of yourself and so should your husband for letting you act stupid. Shut the #$%$ up and apologize to everyone for lying right now before you get beat up. Quick side story about my grampa that i wanted to tell you all. This man is my true hero in life and i love him dearly. You will soon know why i am the way i am. Hes a crusty old Marine Sergeant from WWII that always used to say "stop cryin, i had to charge omaha beach, how do you think i felt!" I came back from fishing at the lake one morning, i used to spend summers at his lake community house. I was on the back stoop cleaning my catfish and he was standing at the door watching me. I went back to cleaning my fish and he kept on standing there watching me. I finally said "what is it grampa?", he says to me "you know what im trying to figure out?". I said "what grampa?", he said "im tryin to figure out whether or not i need to whoop your #$%$ or not cause i know your gonna do somethin to mess up, so lets just get it outta the way now.". Your my hero grandfather, I love you. He raised me right and helped make into the man i still strive to be to this day.
Let me ask you MR Lunchpad, aka THE DORK!! Who really gives a s*** if your a #$%$ face or not!
You dont even make any sense so how bout we go stand in a corner before you hurt yourself. Go partake in your favorite past time and go look up some internet porn and think about how much you hate yourself, and hate your life. Change starts with you friend.
Katherine Tee is full of baloney! She is in need of attention - oh great sailor!
How uncomfortable must other boaters feel when Mrs. Tee, with her hallucinatory eyesight, is in port? Mrs Tee...I pity the fool...
She certainly didn't use up HER 15 minutes of fame wisely. Give me a break.
It was already reported in the past that this flight carried LITHIUM BATTERIES in their cargo, and they had caught ON FIRE in the past on other flights. So this is likely what happened with this flight. Plane went down on fire, exactly what the woman saw ...
She waited this long to report it? She must be a nitwit. Utterly appalling.
Saw it in March and says nothing until now?! Sounds like a 15 minutes of fame publicity stunt.
This should fuel another three months of CNN coverage.
LMAO, Just coming forward now? Given the daily media blitz, especially the 24/7 coverage by CNN, this sounds strange. Is this the same person who claimed she was Anastasia, met Amelia Earhart, and had lunch with Elvis?
That plane, passengers and crew are all dead. The plane burst into flames and crashed into the ocean, all hands were lost. Let's move on please. Tragic, yes, but families feeling can not change the facts. The plane is gone there were no survivors.
There would have been some debris floating on the ocean surface. Something! Seat cushions float...
They will never find that plane whole or in pieces. Very Tragic but true.
the camera on that smart phone still works whether you can talk on it or not...
Hey! And I just saw Bigfoot! I seriously doubt the credibility of this account.
I would assume she was not on this trip alone? No one else saw what she saw? She didn't bother to get coordinates for this odd occurrence? Two planes above and one in the water and she didn't think this odd and mention it to anyone else until this late date. And she didn't hear anything? No sounds of a plane being shot down, no explosions? This is probably bogus.
She was on the trip alone. Her husband was on the sailing excursion with her.
Jesus Christ this story has no bearings of where she was at the time of this observation?
I wonder what kind of drugs she was on that led her to the default conclusion that she was "hallucinating" if she did, indeed, really see the plane. Probably some stupid broad looking for her 15 minutes though.
If a pilot suddenly appears and backs up her story, you know it's a cover up...
If this is real, then congratulations. You may have been the last person to see the missing flight. However, I have reason to believe this claim is false. 1) People generally bring cameras with them on boating trips. Where's the pictures? 2) Why are you sailing from India to Thailand in a tiny little speedboat? 3) What's this part about the plane being ELONGATED? Are you sure you weren't sailing through the Bermuda Triangle, or maybe playing a little bit of Tomb Raider?
I believe that photo is a representation created by someone else. They said they were sailing, not in a small speedboat.
There ya go, Katherine Tee, you got your 15 minutes of fame, even though you are full of #$%$, you get your 15 minutes because the media will print anything these days.
It's possible there was still power to to the running lights, unlikely but possible.
I bet she is going through menopause, I saw it too, but I just can't recall where.
We all saw that sometime crossing Indian Ocean to Australia and sometimes between Malaysia and India too.
If this woman was that angry at sea, it,s a wonder she wasn't thrown overboard.
Sounds like a case of alien road rage!
Is this an April Fools joke? Some dumb #$%$ says she "thought she was hallucinating, or going insane" is her reason for waiting months to tell her story. Did it take that long for the LSD to wear off. "It caught my attention because I usually don't see planes with smoke and flames coming out the back", well NO #$%$ lady!! We need to make sure this women is not allowed to have children...
Since the passenger's cell phones were active and near a cell tower the next day, what's-her-name was just going for her 15 minutes of fraudulent fame. This will be proven when Israel shoots down the rigged plane as it comes in from Pakistan.
Sounds to me like ole Katherine Tee was a bit tipsy that night. S he said she thought she might be hallucinating If 2 other planes were above this visage then surely they would have seen something and reported it. Tee feels bad about not saying something sooner.Heck she just now is sobering up. Tippecanoe and Tee too
The part about there being two other aircraft with the supposed 370 made this too bizarre to take seriously but who knows? We will never know probably. Has Roger Daltrey admitted that the black box will NEVER be found yet?
Got to figure someone somewhere saw this plane after it turned back over the Indian Ocean. If it wasn't a plane she saw , what was it? As for 2 other planes, highly possible, but getting a gauge on distance is pretty impossible. Cant blame this woman, blame all the high up authorities who screwed up on this missing plane flight story. Don't know what comfort this may bring to families who may have had their loved ones incinerated.
Thanks, Gerald, for not much of anything.
Because it couldn't have possibly been any other airliner.
I hope they follow up on this and investigage the area where this woman thought she saw the plane. it could be a lead. I believe they should follow every lead to give closure to their families.
Several fishermen in the Indian Ocean described the same thing: a plane on fire that was flying abnormally low.
she's right. I saw the same thing that night I was working late out on my unicorn ranch.
A 777 has between 314to 451 seats and all the seat cushions are floatation devises, plus what ever else floats! All the resources that have been used to find this aircraft and not one piece of floating debris has been found???? I guess if we can have a presedent who breaks the law and gets away with it then why not some idiot who saw lights in the sky and called it flight 370.
Tony R, what are you saying, are you meaning precedent, as in established practice? Or is that a typo and you really mean "president" as in Obama? If it's the latter and not the former, what law was it that was broken? Please cite the statute, code, Code of Federal Regulation, treaty, etc. that supports your argument that he broke the law somehow as it relates to the Malaysian flight. Otherwise, trying to make derogatory comments about Obama does not fit within the confines of this story. If you believe otherwise, please state how it fits. Otherwise, you're making an #$%$ of yourself by trying to bring Obama into this.
Janet is a mud shark for sure.
Tony can say Obama is an idiot if he wants
At least their position at the time of sighting could be useful in the search.
Now there will be several who claim to have seen the missing plane. Each with their own story.
But this doesn't fit with all the crazy theories out there. She must have been hallucinating for sure.
Go have several seats! Is this a publicity stunt or what? you're just coming with this information now. Yeah right!
Seriously! If a plan was on fire. It would had been seen by other people or detect by radar. Looks like another case UFO here.
Why is there a motorboat at the top of the story when the people were on a sailboat?
Translation: I was hammered and not sure what I saw that night.
MUST BEEN A GOOD DRINK THEY WERE HAVING OR MAYBE THE RUSSIANS SHOT THE PLANE DOWN.
The Chinese shot it down. They thought it was full of Malaysians.
This woman is an idiot. What the hell was she thinking?
It was probably a P3 Orion following the flight path looking for the missing plane. The other two planes were probably on the search as well.
I am glad to see most of the posts have the same feeling about this story as I do. No reasonable person would wait this long to tell this story if it were true
Maybe this woman is Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna too. Perhaps see has seen Amelia Earhart's plane.
She saw black smoke at night as well as the color of the aircraft. Can't get more credible than that. If the Malaysians said the aircraft was heading to Mars there would be reported sighting. People the government fed the media false info from the start. Don't you get it. the media still believes them and Obama and the tooth fairy.
Congratulations on your 5 minutes of fame!
Tee feels bad for not saying something sooner!! Oh yes, I believe her, Months later. This story was covered by many news agency in the World, but yet now comes forward.
What I think the key to this story is the depiction of a sail boat with no sails and the other two jets flying the opposite way. Which brings up another point, the airliner was hijacked and the Malaysian government shot it down for having a liberal screening policy exposed and a not so popular group of Islamic terrorist who just embarrassed them. Might explain the revolving Malaysian stories. The one thing I believe is the Malaysian gov't has never told us the truth. Another interesting problem with as many satellites covering the globe how could anything travel as long and far as MH 370 and not be tracked by several satellites. I think Barry is covering something up too.
I agree about the possible embarrassment. However, not about the possibility of global, all knowing satellite surveillance. Sure, a satellite might spot something, but knowing exactly which image, area and time-frame to analyze is a full-time job (literally). They do hire analysts for that. This is especially true if it went off-course.
@ Dan - nonsense. If those satellites can track enemy missiles headed our way, they can track a huge plane just as well.
Anything is possible. Even CNN could not locate it.
Carl, there was no mention of jets in the story, or of a boat, just a picture of one.
And here come the conspiracy theories.
She "thought" she saw a jet liner on fire in the ocean and she just did not think it was important to report it. The disappearance of the airliner made national news. Maybe she has just reported so many UFO sitings the officials do not believe her any longer.
Was this before or after she found Atlantis?
More nonsense and more lies. That is all I read on the internet.
This report dovetails with the report from an Australian working on an offshore oil rig that came out a day or two after the plane went missing. I never understood why that report was not taken more seriously since it appeared quite credible. It included the coordinates of the offshore oil rig and heading and estimated distance to the burning aircraft. That report occurred in the south china sea at about the time communications were lost with the plane. The Australian reported that the fire went out after about 10 seconds. A possible explanation would be that the onboard baggage compartment fire extinguishers were discharged at that time, momentarily extinguishing the fire. After turning west and crossing over northern Malaysia, the fire probably reignited. Thus the Indian Ocean sighting by Ms. Tee.
Yeah, except she was in the Indian Ocean to the west of Thailand. Duh.
@Duncan, most American's don't know their geography now adays. They also can't read and comprehend anymore either. Reasons were given for the dismissal of the oil rig workers report.
If that plane lasted 5+ hours while on fire and billowing black smoke like they said, a chicken can drive a car. Most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, must be one amazing plane..I tell you that much.
No worries Ken you make sense and the two fools insulting lack logic and common sense. The Oil rig Aussie was in the Gulf of Thailand, so most northern part of S China Sea. MH370's early route took it over the Gulf of Thailand on its way towards Vietnam. All the radar data and the ATC contacts conform MH370 was definitely over the Gulf of Thailand and then made an abrupt left turn that eventually took it back over the Malaysian peninsula and then over the Indian Ocean. If MH370 caught fire from the large stash of Lithium Ion batteries in the cargo hold forcing an emergency change of direction to the west back to Malaysia and noxious fumes incapacitated the crew prior to a distress call being sent the aircraft would have flown on fire from the Gulf of Thailand to the Indian Ocean making both the sailing woman and oil rig worker possible witnesses. Given the confused state of this investigation that is still a very real possibility. Good job Ken.
Glen, you obviously don't know how lithium ion fires start and burn. There's a very long smoldering period and that aircraft very well have continued flying with an incapacitated crew until for an extended period until the fire eventually spread to a critical system.
"Boeing Dreamliner battery fire hot enough to melt fuselage, tests show" Should answer your question.
Baboon, Boeing dreamliner fires occurred with operational batteries in the system, not stored, packaged batteries in the cargo hold. Totally different scenario.
Not a totally different scenario...a fire is a fire no matter how it caught fire. As soon as those batteries are heated up enough....kaboom.
If the explosion itself didn't bring down the plane altogether, it would have at least blown a hole in the plane. Then you have a battery fire and plenty of oxygen...bye bye birdie.
I'm just saying the Dreamliner battery fires were more serious because those batteries were closer to critical systems that could quickly lead to catastrophe for the aircraft. There will be no kaboom, but lots of smoldering in the cargo hold and it would probably take longer for that fire to spread to something critical. Also though the cargo hold is pressurized I'm not sure the compartment the batteries were stored in was temp controlled, and cold conditions could slow down a thermal runaway and fire spread. It's all speculation at this point but given how little the investigation's uncovered that's all anyone can do. The multiple eyewitness sightings
*the multiple eyewitness sightings needs to be better vetted at this point. Since the Inmarsat data didn't pan out and no other technical data is coming forward what more can be done?
Anything is possible, but the likely hood of it that it was a fire diminishes significantly the longer the plane is flying, and yes there's a high chance that it will explode. Especially Lithium, The reason it would explode is because the lithium-ion battery's explosive tendencies are the result of a process known as thermal runaway. It's essentially an energetic positive feedback loop whereby increasing temperature causes the system to get hotter, which increases the temperature, which causes the system to get even hotter, and so on. Regardless of the reason, when conditions are right, it's the battery's cobalt oxide chemistry that actually undergoes the reaction. When you heat this material up it can reach an onset temperature that begins to self-heat and progresses into fire and explosion. Also is the reason why battery fires burn hotter than a normal fire. I'm not calling you dumb, the idea that this thing flew for 5+ hours on fire is just dumb. It would be a giant fireball if inflamed for an hour or two, let alone 5+.
Just want to say one more thing, again it's not against you, just basically what you and this lady are referring to is that this plane magically defied the laws of Thermodynamics. Again, like I said before, must of been one hell of a plane.
One. THis wasn't a Dreamliner, It was a 777 two different planes. Two. No incidents have yet been reported of battery issues in 777's Three. All plausible eyewitness reports have been vetted. As far as the Inmarsat data the plane could have drifted once it hit the water. Why do people feel this is such a cut and dry search?
Big poppa, One, you must have failed reading comprehension in school b/c no one on this thread said this was a 787 we know it was a 777, Paul was explaining how the lithium ion fires on the Dreamliner burned as a point of reference, 2: Though there are no lithium ion batteries in the operational 777, MH370, as admitted by Malaysian Airlines, was carrying a large stash of lithium ion batteries in its cargo hold which I speculate could have been a player in this aircraft's demise. 3, all plausible witness accounts obviously have not been vetted since this English woman on the sail boat in the IO as she admits only recently came forward. Try to keep up, poppa.
She saw a plane on fire but didn't believe her eyes so she didn't report it??? Sounds like some neglected, spoiled housewife with nothing to do needs some attention that she is not getting from her husband.
This whole thing is strange. While I was in europe in march/april, there were plenty of reports that one of the pilots wife left him, another was that the plane carried atleast 5 million in gold unregistered to china. It is still my opinion that someone hijacked the plane and kidnapped all those technitians that worked for US company that is in the process of developing cloaking devices. That company lost about 40% of it's workforce, that is enough to recreate the technology. Pretty much every country would want that device, including terrorists. Considering how aggressive china has been stealing technology and how ruthless they deal with any opposition, think it's certainly plausible they could have a hand in this. There been no debris found, I think the plane has landed somewhere and either been sank or hidden somewhere.
The plane's deadly cargo was actually batteries. Lots of them. These could have caught fire and caused deadly fumes too. This is the second report of a plane seen on fire. Who knows if either are true. The first was a New Zealand oil worker who saw what he thought was a plane on fire, and reported it as a possible plane on fire, giving time, winds, seas, trajectory from his view point. this info was disregarded so a week later he emailed the info to his boss, in New Zealand, and that's when it was made public. he was off the coast of Viet Nam I believe on a platform.
You should be a writer. You certainly have a vivid imagination that can come up with lots of different plot lines for a story
Unfounded rumors spread much faster than truth because the "facts" they present the public are much more juicy. See the problem??
And in this day of cheap cellphones with cameras and video recording, she somehow didn't take a pic or video?
I just remembered that I was out swimming in the Indian Ocean at that time. Come to think of it, I saw the plane as well. The passengers were hanging out on the wings having a few drinks and dancing. Don't know why I just now thought to tell somebody. It's not like I'm insane or something....
the pilot was an "avid supporter" of the malaysian opposition leader, who had been sentenced to prison just hours before takeoff, the pilot was also in the courtroom for the verdict. my wife suggests they were secret lovers and its a predominantly muslim nation which would be a national embarrassment for such a story to be out. It's as good as any information that has been put out to this point.
Didn't all this happen in the middle of the night? If so, how could she see any details about the aircraft, judge distance, or determine if there was a fire? What was she doing up at 3-4AM local time anyway? Something doesn't smell right.
Makes perfect sense coming from a person who lives in a country that stills believes in Kings, Queens and royal families.
What would the two planes flying above it be? Sabotage? Inexplicable.
Okay Katherine Tee, you got your 15 min of fame!
Sorry but I call B__S___. She just wants her 15 minutes. How many people have come forward saying they saw the plane in how many different places? Now three months later she comes up with I saw a plane on fire with black smoke behind it and two other planes above it going in the opposite direction? I didn't report it because I thought I was going crazy, ( I believe the going crazy part). The story should be easier than most to collaborate. Where were you and what time was it? Now find out who controlled that or the surrounding airspace at that time and figure out what two airplanes were in the area, who they belong to, who was piloting them and why didn't they report seeing a flaming airplane?
my question is, if there were other planes up there, would the burning plane show up on the inflight radar? if so, why wasnt it reported?
Had she instead reported seeing a UFO no one would have had problem dismissing her account citing any number of reasons and requiring corroboration by a witness of more credible stature. But since the reason for this eyewitness account is to pacify those who will not put to rest the fact that this DOES not happen without the entanglements of foul play (Not terrorist, but criminal, because a terrorist does not act without looking for attention and claim of responsibility. Criminals, especially political and government criminals, thrive on anonymity cloaked in unresolvable circumstantial evidence) or totally out of the ordinary natural circumstances, then her testimony, regardless of how ridiculous, is valid. Meanwhile the 20 members of the military cloaking device patent developing Company who were all on board of the fight and that have perished leaving behind a prominent world figure is sole control, have not drawn any connecting scrutiny by any self-respected investigative team. I know, I cannot help it, it is my nature to be observant and cross tees and dot i's, which is often time mistaken for stupidity or conspiracy theorist behavior by those who will readily believe anything explained by those in position of authority.
an eye witness of the m370 flight on fire ...doesnt tell us anything except what we have guessed at in a hundred different ways..nothing new
does nt tell us anything new
Sounds extremely plausible. Thank you, DD!
"Meanwhile the 20 members of the military cloaking device patent developing Company who were all on board of the fight and that have perished leaving behind a prominent world figure is sole control, have not drawn any connecting scrutiny by any self-respected investigative team." Oh no, you're definitely not a conspiracy theorist.
I had a dream of the flight's location. Should I report that to the news media? I just think someone wanted their 90 seconds of fame.
No. Wait a couple of months then report it.
Salivating? Wolf Blitzer has a full-on robot chubbie in his pants!
Fox is sweating...even lower ratings next month. They have their lowest since pre 9/11.
We have breaking news hear at CNN....AAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!
We have breaking news here at CNN. AAAGGGHHHHH!
Hey T...Whose been NUMBER ONE EVERY WEEK for I dont know the last 12 years? Oh yea FOX!
Fox news is number one to miss informed viewers.
CNN reported that some undersea company had actually seen plane images on the ocean floor near India - reported this and then zip heard nothing further. The news is so manipulated that we only hear what little they want us to hear.
I can believe the fire but seeing smoke in the middle of the night is a bit tougher. I think if it was far north Indian Ocean the plane could have went down in the dark, but if she says South Indian Ocean then it was said to go down at close to 8am. If she saw it I am sure her husband as well might of and the fact no debris means she saw a hallucination or was dreaming. No debris anywhere still and from a burning plane going down we would have seen debris by now.
If it was Night.. and she did see it. You would probable be able to see smoke, even at night. Since your in the middle of the ocean it would be pretty bright, on a clear night. Not like being in a city.
If the smoke blankets out the stars you can get an idea of what it is...
and when you're sailing across the ocean you trade watch, so her husband may have been sleeping below deck.
You forget that in the middle of the ocean, and even with out moonlight there is no light to obstruct your view of the sky against a starry night. I live in the rocky mountains and I can make out a jet and its contrail with no problem.
Only a brainless idiot would not take action in a situation like this. I mean, with all the media this tragedy has brought about, why not take action sooner? Brainless idiot woman!!
It would be a far more important story if KT could reveal exactly, or at least approximately, where she saw this flaming plane go down. The story says it was spotted by her somewhere in the Indian Ocean while they were traveling to Thailand. That's not at all helpful.
So two other aircraft were in the vicinity and in a position to see it, and they didn't report it either? Sounds more like this loony lady is describing a dream she had.
I sit on my porch all the time and can see planes very clearly both day and night. I can't believe with all the millions of people, military, radar and satellites that no one has a clues where this plane is.
Another witness about the Flight MH370? Here we go again!
Why is it so beyond belief that she actually saw a distressed plane that night that matched the reported course of MH370? Misdirection and sleight-of-hand are often used by governments to distract the gullible.
If she assumed it was a hallucination, why should we contradict her?
Geezus - if you see an accident as it is happening on the freeway, you call 911. You don't care that there are 100 other people who might be doing the same thing. JUST REPORT A PROBLEM, don't assume ANYTHING else. In the case of this plane, her radio call may not have saved any lives, but could have saved a LOT of grief and $$$$$$$ from the fruitless search efforts. This not doing anything is the epitome of dumb dumb dumb.
I disagree. If I see an accident and I am pretty sure 100 people have already called 911 there is NO need for ME to call also. Just clogs the phone system up. And I am not sure everyone in India and Thiland have cell phones up there year and I know there are not towers in the middle of the Indian Ocean. But she could have reported it before now. Wonder why hubby did not see anything.
Well she did think that she was going insane.
Michael spoke of the pilot's life falling apart....so WHY would you kill all of those people? Good grief! My first husband left me and I lost my home along with it. I'm still here because I trusted Christ and not some god idol. I am remarried to a much kinder man and am so happy. Just because something falls apart does not mean that God has abandoned you. "I will restore the years the locust hath eaten." Joel 2:25
she is a wealthy brit with no life. no really.
No life and apparently more money than brains.
Free 2B, if the phone system is clogged up, your call won't go thru - that's how cell phones work. And if everyone thought like you did, NO ONE would try to make the call. She would be using a ship-to-shore radio, not a cell phone. JUST MAKE THE CALL!!!!
Dr. #$%$ - It is MY choice. And it has been proven time and time again that most people do not think like I do. Most people have that cell phone so far up their butt it is hard to know how they make the calls. People want to be part of the lime light. They want to be the one that calls 911. Redhead - That will not happen. The last time I called 911 to report something the dispatcher smarted off to me. Told me "they already knew" and hung up on me.
Maybe, just maybe, they weren't smarting off, just had to rapidly clear the line for other calls, on the same or other emergency. They don't have time to be sociable when they get busy.
Stories on the missing airliner are getting more and more weird. What will come up next , somone seeing a UFO latching on to it and taking it away? We need to leave it to the serchers and let them spend thier time scanning the ocean bottom for a pile of aluminum.
This will always be a mystery. What price is placed upon human lives vs government secrets?
This woman may be "Hallucinating", but she may have actually seen something of importance... Don't be so quick to assume that she is nuts... If her story turns out to be true and accurate she will either be a huge Hero or a Dead woman after the perpetrators get a hold of her...
Did she get a fix on her position on GPS, and did she get a heading for the aircraft?
Couldn't the graphics creator have made it the sailboat it was? Boats like that shown do not make ocean voyages.
Since her viewing was during the night I can understand her apprehension to say she definitely saw the plane on fire. Most interesting of her sighting were the other two planes close to the one on fire. This explains a lot. Poor people. Nose diving inside a plane is bad enough, but at night, scary.
Shortly after the plane went missing there was a story about somebody sailing in the Indian Ocean who reported a low flying plane. It would appear that the story was gagged from further publication.
How very odd that she wouldn't report it right away, or after she started seeing all the news coverage. Perhaps she was afraid of being interrogated? There has to be some other reasons than the ones stated. Those don't make any sense.
If it was the plane, then the lithium-ion battery cargoes on board could be a cause of the slow burning fire which was undetected at first until the plane signal mechanism were closed.
Slow burning fire gives time to head for land, or else the plane would be crashed on the shallow water off of Malaysia.
The heating caused by the lithium-ion battery cannot be initially detected , the same case as in some laptop ( like Toshiba Satellite etc. ) but as the smoke emission increase, the pilot must have turn-off the major electrical connections including external communications untill the flammable medium of the Lithium cargo burst into uncontrollable flame.
She just remembered?? Took a while to,sober up? Was she and hubby running drugs and were stoned? Sounds too weird to be believed! Where is hubby?? Drowned I the Indian Ocean??
Katherine Tee's story is a Huge Crock of Tschidt and is consistent with those having a need for recognition. The more she speaks and the more she responds to specific questions, the sooner the public will realize how Huge the Crock is. Now we have NOT one plane, but TWO, and no one has missed the other plane or reported it missing. Then the mystery remains as to why that second plane did not report what Tee saw. All this is proof for the Immensity of the Crock.
The other planes weren't missing. They were above the one on fire. Who knows, maybe the Malaysian flight was bombed or something. We'll know when we find it. But if this woman's story is true, I'm sure whoever the other planes were, they cleaned up the mess and we'll never find it.
"Moving the other way" Since when has reading simple English become so difficult for the average reader - but then again, were're all not average, aren't we, were're all special. Crock? Hmm, what if the other planes were what one might expect - military intercept, that shot down an airliner being hijacked? Gosh, they didn't report their kill to the National Enquirer? What were those pilots thinking?
she said the two other planes she saw flying above the missing one were flying way from it ('moving the other way, at the time'), which (in this scenario) could mean after confirming they had successfully attacked it (?)
Did you even read the article? If you think you did, you need to read it again---this time more slowly...........
Two planes above it with regular navigation lights ,flying the opposite direction.Glowing orange with trail of black smoke sounds like it was on fire.
I took dirt rider's advice and read it again, slowly, and tried my best to make sense of it, finally concluding that it is a bigger Crock that I expected because we must allow for Contrarians, Chronic Obstructionists, Conspiracies and Hidden Agendas to allow for "What iffers,"
She talks about hallucinating and going insane! I am sure she can be believed, wackadoddle!
This should be good for 24x7 coverage at CNN for the next 6 weeks!
Great story at the Bar. If she was sailing that off shore racer, I guess she had a barge full of gas off the stern. I think the whole story is contrived just to keep the incident alive, unlike the passengers.
Wow! I hope her story is true and she is not just another wacko
If I'm going on a trip I take a camera. If I ever see anything out of the ordinary I take pictures. The only one I believe might be authentic is the fisherman. Did they ever do any further investigation on his report?
It's almost impossible to take her seriously, as much as I (like most everyone, I imagine) would like to think she is being honest and shedding light on the situation.
When the common man finds the truth of what the criminal international banking cartels,power is over all world governments there will be a revolution,but by then it will be too late for most of humanity. but in the end the meek will inherit the earth and what is left of it. Then and only then will there be peace and understanding,after much bloodshed,wars,famine and death. Men do lear from their mistakes,but wise men lear from others,.
Were people to learn the truth, it would likely be met with disgust, but general apathy as well. No one will do anything. They'll sit in their easy chairs, stuff their faces with food analogs and talk about the game the next day.
Should be possible to determine who the other aircraft were, unless of course they were Chinese fighters on a mission. (With nav lights on??)
Chinese fighters over another country's airspace? Not sure who would allow that.
Might have been international airspace (between India and Thailand).
A little mid air hostage taking??? Take the people they want...'discard' the rest of the aircraft. Sounds like a mid air operation to me: one plane fulfills the hostage taking while the other is their to facilitate support and defence, if needed. She sounds believable. I don't find her irrational, to say the least. She is basically describing the tail-end of a mid-air military operation. 20 individuals on that plane were working on some top secret stuff. This, what she describes, certainly could not be out of the realm of possibilities. AT LEAST 'SHE' has SOMETHING. The governments and media refuse to breathe a word. Still, people like her really annoy me: wait months or years 'after' the event and THEN come forward...and always with a STUPID rationale as to why he/she weren't forthcoming from the beginning. I swear...there should be sentences for people like this
What are you smoking??? Must be some good stuff!!!!
You sound interested. I must warn you, though, the price for this stuff will take you beyond the stratosphere of Uranus. Ha ha ha.......this is why I love 'Yahoo comments section'
Compete #$%$! For a person to travel the world without a camera!
Were there six satellite pings over six hours? So the plane was flying around near thailand with a fire all these hours?
Does this woman have a history of going insane? I only ask, because I've seen some weird stuff before, and I never thought it was me going insane, unless of course it was one of the handful of times I took shrooms, then it made sense.
sounds much more intuitive than the ozzie search area... the narrative matches where one would expect the plane to be
She should be euthanized tomorrow for being completely out of touch with the human race to wait this long. Either she didn't see it and should be euthanized, or she did see it and and is a waste of oxygen while living for waiting this long.
Great, what was her position at the time? Let me guess they did not have a navigation system on their ship. I am skeptical of her, and any other "eyewitness testimony.
So three months later she believes her eyes? Someone grab her an attention shirt
These days they find a single strand of hair in one acre forest where a crime was committed but they can't find a huge jet liner.
I've seen this story for months, but it wasn't until today that I finally decided to see what it was about.
I think the story is fake. Period.
Sorry I do hope whatever remains they are from the plane are found someday, but this article just made me laugh.
I'm a bit skeptical about this story. First of all, if the plane was on fire, wouldn't it have exploded or crashed into the ocean and leave debris behind? The lack of debris means whatever happened to that plane, it most likely went down in one piece. Secondly, she said there were two other planes nearby, and no one reported it? I find this hard to believe. Maybe she saw something else and she thought it was a plane.
100 bucks it was electronically commandeered and landed intact somewhere. But since everything under the Sun is classified a National Insecurity issue I will put my new tinfoil hat on I made the other day.
If this were true, wouldn't debris have been found especially if it were on fire?
Well I guess the speculation will now be that this is true? But if plane was held somewhere else,and then placed in the area that Sarah is saying, most likely they will start getting sonar hits on this soon?
Was alcohol involved with her vision? Maybe some mind expanding drugs?
Here's the real story: Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little South of Moline. Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't b'lieve what he seen. Laid on the ground and shook fearin' for his life. Then he ran all the way to town screamin' it came out of the sky. Well, a crowd gathered round and a scientish said it was marsh gas. Spiro came and made a speed about raising the Mars tax. The Vatican said, woe, the Lord has come, Hollywood rushed out an epic film and Ronnie the Popular said it was a communist plot. Oh, the newspapers came and made Jody a national hero. Walter and Eric said they'd put him on a network TV show. The White House said, put the thing in the Blue Room, the Vatican said, no, it belongs to Rome and Jody said, it's mine and you can have it for seventeen million. Lyrics taken from PhoneLyrics
Come to think of it, I saw that airplane also. At first I thought it was a meteor and I just never gave it another thought during these last 3 months until I realized that if I spoke up, I would be front-page news for a while. Give me a break!!
So she decided with the ENTIRE WORLD looking for the plane to keep silent. What about her Husband does he share this same intentional lack of curiosity and human compassion? Simple to report her siting to her embassy and let them take it to proper authorities. I would hate to be a victim of a crime with her around...I may never see any help. She would of course be sorry though AFTER I was dead!
Another clue for a mysterious disappearance. Sound skeptical but plausible.
Ah, the English and their conservatively methodological (read: impractical) approach to problems.
So now Tee will be charged for failing to report a crime, what an idiot, either report a crime or keep your mouth shut.
4 months later and she finally decides to say something? What a bunch of cow pies. o_O
This lady must have been halucinating, or making up the story. She would have told just anybody then and they would have looked into it.
I don't believe her. She is just seeking publicity.
Why would one think they were hallucinating? Was drunk or on drugs at the time? Oh, I just randomly see things that are clearly a result of my delusional psychotic state of schizophrenia. That makes no sense!!!
Yeah right that aircraft was shot down or terrorist have it sitting somewhere.
Bull. She would have had this information right away and would have reported it right away if she a) did see it AND b) wasn't trying to figure out how she could profit from it.
It's sad that people don't, or can't, trust what they see today. My first question is why she thought she was hallucinating? Drugs? Alcohol? Mental illness? Once we rule this out... I guess she was afraid to come forward because she may have been targeted by the government, a government, or whomever, for seeing this. After all, using illegal drugs and seeing this could expose her to charges. I doubt it would help, but her coordinates could help at least locate the wreckage. I'm just wondering why, at this point, anyone but the families care. As I have said, I don't recall any other search lasting this long, especially when it was "just people" on the plane. Government planes, spies, nukes, all of these can make sense, but just a passenger plane?
...because yacht owners get their millions by doing drugs. i am guessing you are jealous you don't own a yacht.
lol well go sail from india to thialand in the middle of an ocean and see if you might question something you see. it was obviously very far away from her.
These comments on the MH370 flight really attracts the tin-foil hat crowd.
You know what most peoples' first reaction is when they see something very unusual. We usually say, "This isn't happening". So her story really doesn't sound so far-fetched to me. Like you, I hope this info can help locate the plane because the flight's relatives have gone through hell with the Malaysian government.
Vntr- I did not mention how they got their money for their yacht. In fact, I don't even know if they are millionaires. However, given the fact that they have a yacht and are in the remote vicinity of the Golden triangle, this tends to lead me to believe that a search of the yacht would have turned up either alcohol or drugs. There are very, very few people who do not drink regular basis, excluding Muslims of course. When people tend to go on "vacation," they tend to like to party. If they have enough money for a yacht, odds are they have enough money to purchase illegal drugs. Regardless of what the American media portrays, drugs are far more common among the rich than people realize. One need only look at Clinton, Bush, and Obama to see that these three presidents have admitted to using illegal drugs in the past. When you take into consideration the fact that she did not trust her own vision and wanted to forget what she saw, ignoring the fact that she was in the middle of the ocean (which would have been a far more logical excuse for not immediately reporting), it makes one wonder. Lillian-perhaps it is just me, but I have never experienced the "this isn't happening" situation. If I had, the first time I was shot I probably would not have survived until the second. The only time I have come close is in retrospect when I consider how messed up the system can be or how some people can react so obviously incorrectly. In today's world, the only thing that would truly shock me would be for everyone to suddenly lay down their weapons and declare peace.
How do you see black smoke trailing an aircraft in the middle of the night with no ground lights? It is more likely she saw a different aircraft just after sunset and the lighting conditions made the contrail look like black smoke and the orange refracted light reflecting off the aircraft as fire. I have been asked to analyze many photos of meteors on fire streaking downward toward the earth with a smoke trail behind it that turn out to just be aircraft flying level and angles and lighting conditions make it look like a meteor on fire.
It is very possible to see balck smoke at night, in a place where there are no ground lights and if there were any moon light at all. Very possible if on fire. Also, is it possible someone shot this plane down? I heard that 12 people on board were the key programmers for a propriety human DNA software about to hit the market. A key principal of the software company was not on the flight. .
More like that she was stoned out of her gourd.
thus y she kept silent all this time
Great, now all your paranoid conspiracy theorists are going to go crazy with your idiotic ideas.
Thought....IF she did see the plane AND IF there were two other planes nearby, is it possible the plane was shot down? I think there were reports of planes being scrambled by one or more countries, including Maylasia, but supposedly no plane was located. Imagine the ramifications if the plane was shot down? What country would actually admit to this horrendous act, even if in error? Covering it up would be their only recourse...we shall see.
Well, both the US and Russia have shot down passenger airlines in the past and both came clean right away. What country did it? No country that the plane is known to have passed over had any interest in shooting it down and would have no interest in covering it up.
Malaysia...not a bright bunch of bulbs AND IF proven they were involved, they would lose much, aside from not fessin' up. The airline is owned by their country and the outcome of any lawsuits would put them out of business. Hope this possible lead is followed up on ASAP.
I think she is seeking attention . Anyone can say they saw the plane going down. The other 2 planes , is she saying possible the plane was shot down because 0f the fire ?
With all the hullabaloo over the missing plane and its passengers, why in God's name would she not report what she saw on the same night it disappeared? What does seem strange is that she saw two other planes that never reported seeing anything strange?
Plane was on fire because it had LITHIUM BATTERIES on board in cargo section. This was already mentioned before .
The truth will never come out. The plane will never be found. There are people who want to keep it that way. Supposedly, it was carrying a top secret US drone control center captured by the Taliban and destined for China. Notice all the Chinese technical experts on the flight.
Did her husband see the plane too or was he looking down -- sweating and concentrating?
They're not telling us about the mermaids and the Loch Ness Monster's brother that she saw too. Or maybe she had given herself a little chemical zip, which was why she thought she was hallucinating.
Wow. If this story is to be believed, and that remains to be seen, it suggests that the plane was shot down. The two other planes could not have been trying to help the plane or we would have received the benefit of the information those two pilots could provide. So, are we to believe this story?
In case you didnt know, it was already reported in the past, that this flight carried LITHIUM BATTERIES in their cargo, and they had caught ON FIRE in the past on other flights. So this is likely what happened with this flight. Plane went down on fire, exactly what the woman saw ...
That's a big jump from a plane carrying lithium batteries to them catching fire and causing the plane to go down. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but we don't have any information that supports it either.
I saw the plane flying and in the cockpit was a blow up captain, then I woke up and Airplane was on the TV. Seriously, I hope this one gets figured out for the grieving families.
Congratulations! YOU just got your 15 minutes!
Made the observation right after smoking a joint?
No, Amelia Earhart told her this story.
is this lady living under a rock, she did not report it until 3 months later? There should be a radio in her sail to use in case of emergency in her journey! I doubt this lady to be credible.
You all notice how this article brings up memories of experiences you all had? Lemme tell ya something...Look up Diego garcia military base...look up Phillip Wood...do more research and do not rely solely on them to tell you what happened! Be your own investigators and come up with your own conclusions!
She seriously thought she was going insane.I want what she was on.
Oh boy I hope she not drunk, cause usually when you are on the boat next to you beer or cocktail...
OK, their flight plan was on the S China Sea not the Indian Ocean. How can you see a plane in flames and not have the confidence to report it? If you are doing such an adventure, you must be carrying cameras out of your ears. Where are the pictures?
If that is what she saw it's plain ignorance that she didn't tell someone right away. While saving lives at that point may not have been possible at least they could have investigated it back in March! Some information is better than none even at this late date, but I hope for her sake she did not use her real name!
What was her position when she saw the aircraft? Please post it.
She was laying on her back. Her husband was on top.
Well, it IS possible she in fact DID see the plane! At this point, ANY potential lead could be useful.
Another crazy Brit drinking too much.
The last article about this had a file picture of prop driven plane, this one a motor boat. That boat is not an ocean vessel, it's not even a sail boat. Gotta love online editors who are rushing to fill space without accuracy.
She could be crazy or seeking attention, however it seemed to me at the time that there are so many ships and boats in the ocean that someone must have seen it. On 9/11 one of the planes turned around over our part of Ohio, and a neighbor lady was outside and remarked that she saw a plane kind of low, which is unusual for this part of Ohio. Maybe it was one of the 9/11 planes and maybe it wasn't. She mentioned it to a few people and that was that.
it wasn't. The plane that turned over Ohio was at altitude, probably in excess of 30,000 feet after leaving NJ.
In addition, after the planes hit the WTC, air traffic control pulled every plane out of the sky so I imagine lots of planes were pulling all sorts of strange manuevers.
I have a friend in air traffic control who was working in Cleveland on 9/11. He said it was Flight 93 that came into Cleveland air space.
Why do you say that NaEra Vetm ? Do you have proof that she is crazy. You wern't there she was.
Nam Era Vet that is one of the MOST BARRON areas in the ENTIRE WORLD! The search they just finished was like trying to find ONE PERSON in the whole United States.
Nam Era Vet, you are a Nam Era Nut. Betty, BTW it's 'Barren' not 'BARRON'.
i seen flight 93 the morning of 9/11. no hype no joke and im not seeking attention. i was working outside in a newly developed plaza in Avon lake, ohio we literally seen the plane turn around from west to east.
Nam,been saying same thing for a while.Busy shipping area and this is NOT a Cessna 172! Someone must of seen or heard something.
"a neighbor lady was outside and remarked that she saw a plane kind of low, which is unusual for this part of Ohio." Thats why they call it fly over country. Its meaningless.
I believe her too. She doesn't sound like a #$%$ to me.
It took her many months to put together her lie and there are still so many loopholes in it. Nice try.
The writer really does not ask nor disclose what time it was at the supposed time of siting. Was it dusk or late night and dark. Was there a full moon or no moon light at all? This "article" really leaves more questions than it does answers.
Now if she could give details of recorded navigation mapping of her location, and diver's find the Malaysian flight MH370 debris, etc...then PRESTO, you hit the jackpot on your LSD hallucination!
It is possible that what she saw was the flare coming from the two searching aircraft when they spotted her sail boat.
I have come to the conculsion that this aircraft will never be found they don't even know where to look. personally I think maybe it was flying saucers got it
she thought it was more likely she was going insane? she must be tiptoeing the thin line between sanity and insanity to just write off anything out of the ordinary as insanity. or smoking something. I saw what I thought was a meteorite the other day. My first thought was: that was a meteorite.
Only fools will fall for this lie. Her observations do not meet logical science standards at all. She may as well say that she saw Santa Clause at the controls of the plane also, and it was being pulled by raindeer.
I have learnt that the World is so complex it out-smarts Science and technology. As absurd as Tee's story is don't dare relate it to science but rather to logic.
Another person who wants their 15 minutes of fame! Why would she think she is hallucinating? Did she take a drug known to do that ? Had she "hallucinated" before?? I am sure I saw a UFO one night and I never thought , Oh I am hallucinating??? If I thought I saw a plane going down I would be in 911 sooooo fast....
How many other hallucinations has this woman had?
I would believe this woman as a credible witness than all the other people in the past several months. Some people take forever to get their brains going.
and she was also abducted by aliens that came to her trailer park.
I suspect we'll be hearing conspiracy theories about this missing plane for a very long time...
Aliens took the plane and now they are all being probed from the backside.
Blimey it took her long to realise she should share her story with the media, i wonder how much she was hoping to get paid.
Does she know the difference between night watch and a knap under a blanket at night time? Certainly hope she gets a better yacht, as this one is very bland!
So, after all this time and hysteria over MH 370, NOW she comes forward. Chalk this one up as another go-nowhere lead.
two things is certain. one, there isnt yet a technology that can track everything that is flying until it lands or crashed and/or there are really bad people that will do anything to cover up their interest. If there are equipment that have been tracking that plane even if the the plane transponder has been turned off, it can only be assumed that it would belong to a super power nation with its leaders having a bad agenda. Malaysian leaders even tho far from being ideal are not up to that stage where they would want to mess with a super power, China being one of them. With majority China citizen on board, I would strike Malaysia out for having bad intentions. Malaysian Air force shooting it down? unintentionally? Not a chance. They are not THAT stupid. Or clever depends how you look at it. Naive maybe. Spent 17 yrs with them. Well my opinion and only comment on this incident.
azimy your talking out of your head dude
azimy you want to get a motel room
THE ONLY person that made any sense was last week,when a question was posted.why wasn't there a military aircraft sent up when it went off course and flew the next few hours.good question.
She just provided CNN with another weeks worth of coverage material.
I call B.S.! Now she feels guilty ? Guilty of what, watching it getting blown up from a military exercise and was told by the military not say a word about it or else ? So she comes up with a half truth ? I'm not buying it! COVER UP!
Ooh, ooh, me, me, I saw it too. It looked like a Malaysian jet on fire, but I wasn't sure then, but I am now. And I saw Amelia Earhart''s plane too, but I didn't really think about it then. Plus, I was at Wal Mart last week and saw Jimmy Hoffa in the produce section, buying radishes. Plus, I was camping in California a couple of weks ago and had coffee with Bigfoot. At lest I THINK it was Bigfoot; maybe Sasquatch, I'm not sure...
And do I even dare mention that I saw Elvis at the Walgreens pharmacy, I was even thinking, it can't be him, the salesperson would have reported.
Really? And you're JUST NOW sayin' something? Wow! So how long have they been trying to located this plane?
B.S. For months she knew there was a massive search involving thousands of people. It would have taken her 5 seconds to send an email or radio somebody, even if she wasn't sure what she saw.
Thank you British woman! You truly enlightened me of what actually happened. I now have a closure myself. God bless you!
If you could not come forward then when it happen, why come forward now? To me a plane on fire is significant information that should of been reported to tell authorities where it might of crashed. It could of saved lives.
Minor details when you are #$%$ at the old man.
she was out on the ocean. saw 2 planes above it and thought it would have been reported.
AND THOSE FUNNY CIGARETTES SHE WAS SMOKING HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SIGHTING. GIMME A BREAK. ANOTHER ONE THAT WANTS 15 MINUTES OF FAME. SHE SAW A PLANE ON FIRE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO REPORT IT. SHE WASN'T GOING INSANE !! SHE IS INSANE !!! GET A LIFE.
Still believe China shot the plane down after the IFF transponder was shut off. The reports of the two other aircraft in the area of the plane makes this theory even more believable.
If she thought she was going crazy, surely she would have asked her husband to verify what she was seeing? What did he see??
Oh yea I forgot I saw a plane crash a few weeks ago, but I didn't think it was anything major so I told absolutely no one about, until now of course.
Did she describe the P-3 Orion in the picture? If so she must have really been hallucinating.
Don't feel too badly Tee, there were other reported eye witness sightings of the plane that the authorities ignored completely.
The 777 looks longer then most planes, it has exaggerated wings and a very long hull.
If she had reported this when it happened, she nor her boat might be here to tell the tale.
I believe her. Both her reaction at the time and later the statement appear to be perfectly normal. Our brain often try to write it off immediately after we witnessed something that's mind-boggling.
A plane is crashing before her eyes and she says NOTHING? NOT CLOSE to a normal reaction, especially for someone at sea who relies on communications if in trouble themselves. This is a baloney false flag story if you ask me! It seems some parties are going to extremes to put this missing plane behind them either for insurance reasons or as a cover up for some clandestine activities related to this plane and its occupants.
She questions her sanity once too often for me. Yeah, I'm starting to question her sanity too.
Well maybe she did? You and I don't know that. Lots of people see things, and for a variety of reasons, just don't get involved. Perhaps her and hubby were running something illegally and she didn't want to draw attention to herself and her boat until she got home and offloaded the questionable cargo??? Could be anything really! But if they find the plane using her lead, then we know she is telling the truth and she gets all the credit for solving the mystery. Even if it's 3 months late.
Instead of argument she can lead the search to the area.
She was in fact under the influence of some foreign substance. She was so spaced out that didn't realize that the whole world was looking for MH370. Did she know that it was one of the meteors falling from the sky in the dead of night? Yes, that is it. It was the meteor. Therefore she did not summon the authorities.
Sounds like a bad person looking for attention. What a sick freak.
Not so much as 1 seat cushion found? Not 1 life vest or other passenger ticket that can float? Nothing? No oil slick? The 1 or 2 pings by a couple of ships are now being given serious doubt? This story sounds as phony as the official version.
Sounds at least possible. If she can give a precise time and location, then someone needs to check whether there were two planes known to have been there. (That should be fairly easy to do, if a bit tedious.) If that part of her story fits the facts, then her claim of a plane on fire starts to look distinctly plausible.
Her story has no more holes than the malasian governments and she could have seen smoke if it was clear and a large moon although it does seem fishie but worth checking out..Two aircraft could have been malasian gov. shooting it down know there covering it up.TRUST NO ONE!!!
This plane has been missing for over two months and there is still no wreckage showing up anywhere in the world. No other planes can say that they saw a plane on fire, this woman THINKS she saw the plane on fire in the night sky but cant truly recall. Where was her husband, why did she not ask him? My theory is that plane drifted off in outer space. Use the satellites to search up there. If they know how far away the next MEGA Earth is, then they can easily see a few thousand miles on earth. The government is hiding something
The plane would have never made it out of our stratosphere. It requires a tremendous amount of energy to leave the planet.
This gives CNN another 2 months of something to talk about!
The best way to convince people you seen something is by unconvincing them first.
Had she been a serious *anything* she would have charted it and radioed it back to authorities as soon as she was capable. It would have been up to the authorities to determine the validity of the nature of the call. And I guess the question BEGS asking...why come forward NOW to tell us what an idiot you were...attention-seeking? There's nothing to be gained by this from what I can tell. They are beyond finding this thing.
Witness number __???? So now we are trotting out yet another witness and another tall tale to see if anyone bites. Sorry.... this is plain ridiculous. The data showed the plan FLEW for another 7+ hours. A jetliner on fire does not have a sustained flight path... unless it is in someone's imagination.
A failed terror attack. The plane exploded but the terrorist message didn't get out.
She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time. Something that important I would let someone know even if it I was not sure.
I find it VERY odd that this person is now just coming forth! I have serious doubts about this persons' credibility! Given the multiple modalities of the current day for emergency contact & nothing was done - well, you think about it. Having been on many sailing adventures as well as in isolated desert arenas (Sonoran desert, AZ), there's not what we call "WHITE NOISE (light pollution)", when you're in the middle of the ocean or desert, mid to late night - clarity couldn't be more apparent! You can virtually almost pick the stars out of the sky with your hand! I would even venture to state that if someone thought they saw a "UFO" they'd be readily willing to report such an event! WHY now is this woman coming forth?? Why not use the MAY DAY MAY DAY emergency call for mariners?
Didn't you hear? Potheads are capable of doing brain surgery while high...according to them.
vagdiarrhea; You certainly are just that & your apparent IQ is well below that of fecal matter.
Diffusion of responsibility aka the bystander effect. Simple as that. No need to go so deep in questioning it. Its not like anything she said is actually helpful but its easy from anyone that has any education in psychology or communication. Diffusion of responsibility happens when someone (typically of low confidence or is in disbelief) see something and sees someone else present that they expect will take action. It happens daily all over the world. In this instance the planes she saw above were the reason for the onset of the bystander effect.
She had been drinking that's why. Any sane person would have reported right away!
Good conclusion. To be out in the middle of the ocean, she had to have some experience at sea or her husband would have. Her story although interesting sounds fishy as heck. When would someone NOT report a fire in the sky with smoke trails and two other planes in the vicinity?
This is very sad she held back the info from the media, local authorities or whoever that's something that's been airing since march and you still didn't see anything. !!! Really lady I believe you might have something to do with it. umm bro??? and want reward money. Sorry that's going to the families that you fail to report a large #$%$ plane on fire too....that the families still does not have closer on kill yourself..
The fact that she twice casts doubt on her own metal stability, by saying that she thought she was hallucinating or maybe going insane, if I were interviewing her, would cast some serious doubt on her claims. Maybe that's just me. I don't think I would question my sanity if I saw a plane crashing. I think that my first thought would be, I had better alert the authorities.
Ya, I'm with you. Especially if you were out in the middle of nowhere in the ocean at night. But didn't think to turn it in? Even people as conservative as us, would have done something...just saying.
one of the biggest mysteries in a while, whole bunch of countries looking for it and this twit makes a mental side note of seeing a plane on fire, why didn't she report it the very same day, and to me soundsl like what i heard before either the Chinese or the Russians shot it down by accident that is why she saw 2 other planes following it.
Check the flight logs for the two aircraft she mentions, that were in the area at the time and see if what she is saying can be verified.
I think the plane was trying to get to Pakistan secretly and Iran or India shot it down not knowing what was going on. This was a hijacking gone bad,,no doubt about it
ROXY. lithium batteries do not catch on fire on their own. if these were pack for shipping then they were not connected to each other so the voltage was 3.4 volts at best. the reason the batteries on the plane caught fire was due to a bms malfunction that allowed continuous charging /overcharging causing them to overheat.
Plane was shot down. Terrorism but the Pres will never state or others.
Maybe she is BSing but it makes a lot of sense. My first thought after the plane disappeared is how come other countries' air force didn't intercept the plane
Yeah, and I saw Elvis leaving The Quad yesterday afternoon!
Was that b4 or after she saw Jesus in her spaghetti sauce? Was Elvis on the plane?
This lady make no sense,you traveling in a boat across indian ocean,you see ball fire and smoke,now why would you think you maybe hallucinating id your boat not stranded or you out food but on joy ride with your husband. Next question is did your husband see it too and if he didn't,why didn't you alert him to ask him what he thinks.Main question you see all this media coverage and u notice path of the plane was where you were at the time,why didn't you report it?hmmm I think couple got scared they might be in trouble for not reporting it when they reach Thailand so they kept they mouth shout and sweep it under rub. What made them come forward now?
The story is a complete joke. But hey, she made the news!
Sean - she wants her 15 minutes of fame. Or maybe she was smoking a lefty and didn't want to alert anyone.
she only came forward now after the drugs had exited her system in case she was tested
They were afraid that their spouses would find out where they were that night.
Ever think that instead of questioning others & posting illiterate comments; YOU might need to seek some Basic Adult Education Classes ?
Seeing that sort of event, if this lady was a serious world sailor in the open ocean, there must be a log entry from that watch.
If any of this is true then "someone" (authorities) would find some kind of evidence, wreckage from the plane. I cannot believe that not 1 piece of actual evidence from that plane has not been found or washed up somewhere. Very hard to believe. It was a huge plane with a lot of people and stuff on the plane. You mean 'nothing' floated eventually. That plane was hijacked by terriost and the bowe-bergdahl case is associated with it.
She needed a cooling period to calm down from a torrid affair in the middle of the ocean. The husband was asleep, it figures.
Oh yes, Tee feels bad because she didn't report it sooner. Gimme a break. If the plane was on fire, they would have called in the distress long ago instead of flying for another 8 hours. The pilots wife and kids walked out on him, his favorite political figure was arrested for sodomy, his whole world fell apart. He programmed the plane to take the course it did, took it up to 45,000 ft, turned off the oxygen which killed everybody and the plane followed the programmed course until it ran out of gas. PERIOD.
His favorite political figure was Bill Clinton ??!!
There's no oxygen to turn off, moron.
really? the pilot did all of that, and his co-pilot felt so empathetic that he allowed himself and everyone else to die?
Desperate for attention, she relays a BS story and the news agencies fulfill her wish. Yahoo and most other Internet news sites have become nothing more than cheap imitations of the National Enquirer.
Hey, it was a slow news day. Heck, they almost published a story on the VA.
OF COURSE NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING BECAUSE THE FLIGHT NEVER EXISTED.
Let me see, you see a plane on fire about to crash, the news is full of the entire planet looking for it and you decided now to come forward?? This seems a bit strange to me. In fact the whole incident with this plane seems strange.
Climate change is causing airplanes to disappear.
I bet Skipper, Gilligan, Ginger. Mr. Howell and the rest can tell you where it is. The professor is integrating the black box and a coconut right now and will have everyone rescued in no time,
But he can't fix a 2 foot hole in the SS Minnow? I for one am skeptical that he can do it.
"The next morning" Tee said, "We passed what appeared to be a Sasquatch sitting on a log floating past us. The log seemed to be made of some sort of wood. I remember thinking how unusual it was to see a log so far out in the ocean. I guess I should have reported it sooner but I thought I was just having a reaction from the mushrooms I had eaten the day before."
Modern day navigation equipment documents all routes taken by boats and ships. Let's start by looking at the one on her boat. The husband also needs to be interviewed.
LIES!!!! That video looks fake! I've seen computer animations when I see them, and that is a computer animation! Don't believe it, youtube computer animation and see that it looks just like that!
Um, it is not a video, it is a computer animation made to go with the story.
I want to believe that you're just making a joke, but your attempt to dissuade others from falling for the dreaded "We don't have video of this so we threw together an animation to demonstrate what it would have looked like if it happened" trick makes me think you're genuine in your belief that the obvious animation was meant to make people think it really happened.
Dude you are way out of touch.....
oops I read it wrong. I thought that was suppose to be her cellphone video capture of what happened.
She thought she was hallucinating? Does she do this often?
"British woman Katherine Tee is saying she spotted what she believes is the missing Malaysian Air flight MH370 while she was sailing". Yeah, and she has unicorns and pixies prancing in her backyard at home. Everyone knows that planes is on an island with Gilligan. They're just waiting for the professor to get those coconut batteries up and charged.
Maybe if hubby eats her black box she will hallucinate.
My theory is that shortly after the pilots signed of for the night a fire started somewhere in the storage/cargo area of the plane. This fire quickly knocked out the communications of the plane explaining why the pilots did not contact anyone. They tried to turn the plane back, hence the sudden U-turn but the pilots were over come by smoke and the auto pilot tried flying the plane towards the newly input directions that may not have been completed by the time the pilots expired. The auto pilot flew a radical flight path until the plane exhausting its fuel supply or burning up beyond flight capability simply went down in the sea and sank.
So it was on fire for 6-8 hours and did not crash but the fire was big enough to knock out all communications and flight control ? WOW! Dude, what are you smokin or are you on a natch?
Yeah lol.....Also when planes crash in water they tend to leave "Debris Trails" Luggage, Plastics, these things float....and there was NOTHING. Not even a bag of peanuts from the snack tray....
I agree with Robert. I believe it was an ELECTRICAL fire, though, which does knock out communication devices and oxygen supply/pressurization, but does not necessarily make a huge fireball in the sky. I doubt this woman's statement. Another lunatic trying to get some attention and her 15mn of fame.
Your theory sounds very plausible and I believe the pilot was trying to land the plane and that is why the sudden turn.
And another post that believes it was a fire. There is zero, and I repeat ZERO chance that plane flew, on fire, for five plus hours. It defies the laws of Thermodynamics. You see, simply put, fire equals heat which equals energy. If you say it was the smoke that incapacitated the passengers, crew and pilots, the fire would have to be quite large (or else the oxygen to carbon dioxide ratio wouldn't cause you to lose consciousness). So that plane would be storing the energy that was created by the fire, and what happens when something can't hold anything anymore? It pops, or explodes into a giant fireball in this case. Which is why it's 100% NOT possible that this lady saw what she saw or that plane flew that long on fire. One to two hours max and that plane is gone.
Yea, I saw it too. I was walking along the Missouri River and I spotted something silverish and big. At first I thought it was a Great White, but upon further observation, I came to think it was either a Flying Fortress or the missing plane everyone is looking for. Is there a reward for my sighting?
Strange story. Who were the other two planes? Friend or foe? If friendly why have they remained silent? Many questions inherent with this woman's tale. She says she doubted her own mind. Was she on hallucinogenics? But then again, the Indian Ocean is most likely the final burial site of Malaysian flight MH370. Strange tale with a tinge of eerie.
Her story is confusing for a variety of reasons. One, if it was at night over the Indian Ocean, how low was this plane to see "black smoke" trailing it? Two, if it wasn't night and she was able to see it, how could she have seen two planes "above it" moving in the opposite direction with "normal navigational lights" on them? There is little to no truth to this story.
daily caller, if you are going to utilize an aircraft in the headline of this story, at least use a jet rather than a prop plane. the only thing that bothered me about the story was her observation that two other aircraft were also in her view at that time. not sure but don't think that this part of the indian ocean has a lot of commercial traffic and to see three at one time sounds a bit much.
She's either hallucinating or looking for media coverage. The tip off is releasing a new book.
Well why Yahoo uses a picture of a four engine propeller jet silhouette in clouds is a mystery too because we are talking about a JET.
What kind of moron do you have to be to see a burning plane and think you're hallucinating? If she was high on acid it might explain it. Not to mention that this was world wide news for weeks. How much time was she at sea (without a radio) not to hear about it.
There are to many illogical things in her story.. Just a few,,,,, 1) the delay, after all the news coverage. 2) night time seeing black smoke 3) two other planes going in other direction, but never commenting about a plkane on fire?? What is her agenda?
As questionable as I find this woman's story, I give it far more credence than anything the Malaysian government has said or will say in the future about this plane.
One of the best statements I've read
She could have saw the plane remember even though it is dark out it's not truly black and the moon and the stars give sufficient light outside of man made lights so the light of fire would be bright in the middle of the ocean . And the question is would we have believe her. And if she kept a record of her course then her information is helpful. Now I know nothing about sailing but I just speculating on what she would have done.
Better go back, and check your sentence composition, amigo !
@rob - why not go back and check your manners and sense of relevance.
@Roberta... if you can't handle free-form commenting... don't par tis a p8. whaddaloser.
James, if people aren't told they sound stupid, they will never know.
Poor Robert has nothing better to do.....
Leroy, when people are TOLD, they are less likely to accept. Most of us don't come to these forums for grammar lessons.
"even though it is dark out it's not truly black and the moon and the stars give sufficient light outside of man made lights so the light of fire would be bright in the middle of the ocean" And you guys are defending her??
I think Walker is right. Since the authorities don't seem to have any better clues, they might as well check this story out before they keep sitting on their hands with this.
Moon and starlight is sufficient enough lighting to see black smoke trailing behind an airplane? The light from the alleged fire alone would have made it impossibly difficult to see anything dark around the plane. This lady is a liar and just wants attention.
She was on the deck of a small 40-foot Kalik sailboat -- not what's depicted in that laughable video illustration. . For those who have never sailed a small boat across an ocean, ANY light stands out vividly against a clear dark sky. I believe she saw what she says she saw.
Whatever happened we are continuously being lied to by our own govt.
Did she share this with her partner, Marc Horn? Might add a little validity to her story.
Sure she did. She probably also thinks that she saw Elvis, Jesus Christ, and the Easter Bunny too.
I thought I saw it, too, but since I live near DFW it was just probably another jet, whether inbound or outbound...
I saw an alien spacecraft land in my back yard. Why isn't my story on the front page of Yahoo? Oh, my story has been done before, I get it.
She needs to quit smoking that Indian Hashish.
Is this the same lady that saw pink elephants flying last year?
What the hell kind of mock up is depicted in the above photo? It's a powerboat with a sailboat steering wheel located in the stern of the vessel. I guess Miss Tee will be on CNN for the rest of the week in two hour specials.
Yeah. And I saw it flying over Chicago just last week.
She also spotted Santa's Sleigh being pulled by flying reindeer.
I think you meant to say Father Christmas' Aerial Tram.
I wonder what she was smoking or drinking that night. She waits 3 months to come forward? Let the Malaysian Government know, they have time and money to waste on another wild lead.
I have believed all along that the Malaysian Government has practiced subterfuge to steer people away from the final resting place of this jet for reasons unknown. Now we have at least three separate leads pointing to the area near India somewhere near or in the Bay of Bengal including the GeoResonance company that says they have images of a plane underwater near India, and the newly discovered sound from a Nuclear research team. When will the investigators who have found absolutely nothing so far in their current search area, redirect their attention toward the Bay of Bengal?
I find it hard to believe anyone who takes this long to come forward with this information. I'm sure she pointed it out to her husband as well. Therefore it would be true to her if she really saw it. She saw black smoke in a night sky, at that distance, really? There are to many HOLES to her story!
Yeah and when she got back to the pier she saw Elvis. Apparently he has been getting by just providing sailors with oral sex for candy bars and loose change.
If she saw the plane *on track with it's plight plan* it changes everything. But credible, hard evidence has too much information showing the plan was off it's course and purposely evading.
It can be added to the possible, plausible category. The manifest on this flight also included a shipment of lithium batteries that are known to catch fire in bulk and are well regulated in the US, but not internationally as with this flight. It could explain how toxic fumes may have enveloped the passenger section first, melting burning any communication to the cockpit to alert them of any danger then the cockpit itself, only to fly until they ran out of fuel. Suspected of happening and plausible, this witness may elevate this scenario to more of acceptable, definitive, no.
I've commented on this many times before and this story kind of adds to what my theory was. I was pondering whether it was possible that this plane was shot down accidentally by another country's military. I mean it was flying low, no transponder was registering a ping and not responding to radio calls while flying over several different countries in the dead of the night. Now this woman claims she saw a plane on fire and two other planes flying away in the opposite direction. Just seems eerie to me and I truly feel the Malaysian Govt knows alot more than they are disclosing.
I don't think this story has any credibility at all. As soon as you ask her she will be saying things like I don't remember what was our location at that moment, or something of that nature.
"She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time." wow, are 15 minutes of fame REALLY this important.. come on, if this person saw ANYTHING like that back then, it would have been brought to EVERYONES attention at that time..what the phck is wrong with people, hundreds are DEAD and families are left wondering why, but you just gotta have your 15 minutes of spotlight..what a freak and an a hole,
You clearly have never been at sea for long periods of time. One sees all sorts of stuff, real and not.
@lisa, really? no I have not been at sea for long periods of time, just a week at a time on a cruise multiple times..what the hell does that have to do with this topic though??? you mean to tell me she has been at sea with NO form of contact for the past 4 months and now, golly gee gomer, she wants to let the "media" know she saw something WAY BACK WHEN? were you born an idiot?
Actually, I think it's helpful that some choose to out themselves as nuts. Saves the rest of us time and trouble.
She couldn't believe her eyes, though she was hallucinating. Sounds extremely credible.
Do you know what it is like to be out on the ocean with no land mass in sight? There is nothing for perspective; it can be quite disorienting.
Landed in Cambodia, passengers are POW's in rat cages. Charlie is back
Please let's reward her! It's not easy recovering your memories after you've been hit by a jetliner 3months after! She might use the money to buy a browser,tv,radio and tabloids for her and the husband so they can always hear the news and recount their folk tales/comedies promptly.
LOL and it flew all the way to the south Indian Ocean after this, huh?
WTH would anyone would sail or "yacht" around the South Indian Ocean in the first place? looking for the Thai drug cartel for some "discounted" horse or meth? or seeking prepubscent "courtesans"?
if what she saw was the plane is anyone looking in that location to see if in fact it may be there.
Now how many people in the middle of the ocean see such an incident and sweep it under the rug.....not even discuss with friends or relatives....even if you are insane?? I think this lady is just trying to get under the limelight. Dumbness has its limits.
That area is Pirate Heaven .... so what was a solo sailboat doing in "Pirate Heaven? The entire sailboat cruising world KNOWS that is NOT an area you sail through. Running drugs is a good possibility as to what the sailboat was doing in that dangerous area, and if they were doing that there is also good chance that the observer was using some while she was pulling the overnight watch. Those two factors would mean that there is NO WAY they would contact the authorities in real time as to what she/they saw, because if they did that they would be going to prison for a LONG time. Her report has enough credibility though that they should pull the boat logs to get it's approximate location ("IF" they exist) ... AND also cross check as to where two high flying commercial or military jets might have been over the Indian Ocean, seeable simultaneously about the time that she is claiming she observed this happen. All that though does NOT explain the satellite information received for the next several hours from the airplane.
Only a fool would run drugs into Thailand. Ever seen those prisons they've got there?
Ok. Why would anyone think that they are hallucinating? Also, this has been international news for months now, she would have thought about what she saw the first time that she heard a plane was missing in that area. I would have. The woman is ALREADY nuts, obviously.
This is BS. If she seen this plane, she knows exactly where it went down because she would have navigation devices to pin point a vision she experienced. Looking at her devices, she would have tried to call someone or made a discovery where this took place.
Need to further check the credibility of this lady....and what about her husband. BUT, it plays right into the "thoughts" of the US military from Diego Garcia Military base in the Indian ocean, shooting down a hijacked or out-of-control airplane. We just have to wait for more info. No camera or cell phone shot? Everyone has them.
Honestly, why say something now. Must be wanting their 15 min of fame. And if what they is true, you mean to tell me they had no camera or phone on board? In this day and age, if anyone had seen something like that they would have video taped it and it would have been all over the net by now. These poor families have suffered enough, saying this only adds to their frustration of what happened to their loved ones. This, sadly, is something we may never really know what happened.
there are times I have questioned my own judgement in situations where other might get in trouble and not wanted to say something . maybe she was worried for her safety initially as maybe she thinks someone is guilty of doing something wrong. the truth is, if that is what she saw, better late than never. I do not blame her for holding back.
I saw something in the sky back in 2009 that I wasnt supposed to see., Believe me, you go into shock and you cant move.
Daily Caller is Koch brother propaganda. Tucker Carlson is a douche.
In a related story, Ms. Tee finds 2 million bucks in her bank account and wonders about the mysterious death of her cousin!
I feel bad for not mentioning this sooner, but I saw the plane two weeks ago parked in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico.
Zombie outbreak on plane and the military destroyed it.
Why all the observations that this woman was "high"? I have no idea if this woman saw the missing plane or not...and neither do any of you. God knows we don't have any other clues...who knows?!
Missing Malaysian air flight Mh370= Human guinea pigs for Martian test flight. What is it so hard for folks to believe that their own government is capable of purposely killing them, or kidnapping them for scientific experiments?!!!! You mean to tell me, that they can track my cell phone in a moment of seconds, but they can't find a 747 jumbo jet???? The new world order is certainly alive and well!!! How do people just go missing without a trace??? Oh, I know, the government kidnaps them and use them for different experiments and either kill them or just never release them back into society!!! We've got satellites in space that can see an ant on a piece of lint on a basement floor, but they can't tell us where this jet is???? And yet, the media is complicit with the elite to make sure that everyday, ordinary Americans pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Get real!!! WAKE UP FOLKS!!!
Doesn't her husband have anything to add to her story? 2 eyewitness of possible downing of flight MH370 no one knows about until now....very doubful story.
She thought she was going insane and losing her mind. Lady you are insane and have already lost your mind. So are so far gone for a human being their may not be another documented case in history to the extent of your #$%$ state. You should consider ending it now. Believe me it will not even be considered suicide due to how bad your condition is. Wait and are you saying their is someone just as bad as you. Because she said she is married.
Who sees something like this ...then hears and sees all the media coverage about trying to find this plane ....and she finally now comes forward and says; SORRY I DID NOTHING?
Looking for 15 minutes of fame I suppose. If nothing else it will certainly fuel speculation for all the conspiracy theorist out these.
Experts have always theorized that the plane caught fire. The pilots and passengers passed out and it flew until it ran out of fuel. This person's sighting is just another corroboration...
So she saw what appeared to be 2 other planes above it? I still stick to my theory that the plane was hijacked or the pilot decided to take over and not respond to the radio. Then because of a fear of a hijacking the plane was shot down in a location that's not being revealed. The plane was definitely showing up on someones radar and when it went off course and didn't respond, fighter jets were sent in. Just my opinion.
The U.S. government knows who what when and where..they most likely did the deed.....people on board they had to make dissapear, at any cost......
I can understand not trusting what you think you saw...But when you get to shore, and you hear about a plane crash in the general vicinity of where you were sailing...CALL IT IN DIPS***. Or are you lying to get attention?
Meh, I saw a spaceship land in the apple tree behind the barn last month, too. Didn't think it was worth mentioning though...
When the CIA and Mossad plan things like this no one will ever know the true meaning. The criminal international banking cartels are behind all corruption and wars,so to just know this truth should awaken humanity what has to be done to solve world wars,famine,poverty,and all that goes along with these cartels and the power just a few family have over all of mankind.
She was probably drunk too. But if it is possible to trace back to the date, time, and location of her boat at the time of the "sighting" then it is worth checking it out..
My initial theory about this aircraft was that once they lost contact with the plane, and got no response, jets were scrambled to shoot it down. Wouldn't it be the most logical thing to do if an airliner is flying without contact over a country's airspace?
Can't tell if she is really stupid or a liar.
3 months after the plane vanishes and this woman comes forward now? Where was she the first week into the investigation? If her report is credible and true, the first thing that comes to mind is the theory that the plane was shot down due to the other aircraft seen. The who's, what's and why's still remain a mystery.
In November of 1980 I witnessed the President of the United States meeting with an alien leader and Elvis in the Arizona desert. I took a picture with my trusty GAF camera. I didn't think much of it because I was busy trying to get home so I wouldn't miss another episode of CHIPs-- you know the one where Ponch gets laid while John works. Anyways, I guess I should have developed the pictures instead of trading them for a Stretch Armstrong doll.
I don't believe you saw Elvis.
That was hysterical! Made me laugh so hard I cried.
Whether your story is true or not, this makes an interesting article. :-)
We should all be able learn from our past mistakes - next time you will know better..
hahaha. But seriously, the aliens are involved.
I saw MH370 in the Gulf of Mexico. I will tell my story to the highest bidder.
Wow. Hundreds of people that could possibly have been rescued, dead because you were having marital issues and you thought you were seeing things when you saw a FREAKING BURNING PLANE STREAKING THROUGH THE SKY. That must weigh down your conscience huh?
Michael M! Wonderful story, just like hers
It may be 100 years and many movies and books, but someday the plane will be found. It will be a continuing legend, like Amelia. I can't take anyone seriously who believes the "government" knows what happened but isn't saying.
She looks a bit androgynous but if you look closely you can totally see all three planes in the video.
Human eyes can see smoke in the middle of the night when the orange glow of the flames of the fire are large enough that it makes it possible for the human eye to tell the difference between the fire and the black blankets of contrasting smoke making it impossible to see the whole glow of orange or fire consuming the plane in flight in this instance. Other planes would not report it if they were the cause of the fire on the plane.
Shot down in fire and smoke. Been there, down that. Aint pretty and not fun.
She also had lunch earlier in the day with Elvis and Freeman (below) who has been tracking the Illuminati for 200 years.
This would place the plane in the northern section of the so called curve. This is also close to where it was reported that a corporation ran tests that showed debris was made of the same metals used in the manufacture of the plane. Since they have had zero luck looking where they have been for months I would no be so fast in discounting this report.
She does not mention the type of planes she saw. All important question: Could 2 other planes have missed a burning plane below them? If I were the Malaysia (FAA), I would certainly question her.
She is probably from Colorado and was on dope at the time. Had to wait for the dope to clear her system before coming forward.
The US has a "secret" airbase on an island called Diego Garcia, right in the new path of the flight. A radio silent passenger jet flying directly towards this airbase, not communicating to anyone, no transponder on. I think the US scrambled jets and shot it down. But they can't admit that now.
Yeah...like I believe you. After all, for whatever reasons you claim, you are just now coming forward with this "illuminating" information. I'm sure all the loved ones of those who are lost appreciate that you're now speaking up. Idiot.
I saw Elvis last week eating at Kentucky fried chicken.
"She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time." Um, yeah -- riiiiight. Geez, that doesn't sound completely idiotic or anything . . .
"Whilst in the night and on my yacht...we two did sail...I looked upwards...and I turned pale. What is this object in the dark of night? Was it the missing plane still in flight? Oh, no...it glowed bright orange and from it's tail came smoke. Oh, gosh...I might have been drinking and it's all a Joke." Oh, please....the person saw the plane when? Tells the authorities when? Saw 2 other planes near it and nothing is reported by the phantom planes? No wreckage...no oil slick nothing. I'm inclined to believe it's either been highjacked or it's in another country and no one is saying anything. How sad for the people left behind.
Agreed, but the theory of being shot down (assuming that it was off course, and someone thought it hijacked) still makes sense. The two other planes could have been fighters. I know, the likelihood is so slim, but given the horrible search efforts and nothing found, this is as plausible as anything else.
Good Rumore mill. Malsysian Jets shot down the airliner and that is why the investigation has seemingly been slowed by Malaysia
While walking on the waters of the Reflecting Pool in March, I believe I saw Malaysian Air flight MH370 fly over Washington D.C.
So there I was sipping on a cold beer in my back yard when all of a sudden Elvis Presley, Jimmy Hoffa and Tupac Shakur came streaking through my yard. It was nuts. I thought to call the police but figured that someone else in my neighborhood would call it in. After 3 months of nothing I decided now would be the right time. Not because I want the attention obviously, but because there has obviously been some sort of cover up.
that's not funny at all man. People have been lookin for those guys for a long time....
How do you call 911 in the middle of the ocean. Idiot!
Yeah seriously, you see a plane on fire and see the news for three months and do not report it? If that is the case she should be publicly caned for her utter evil stupidity.
Oh Yeah--There was a party at Selena's place that got out of hand. CNN is running simulations now.
I've long thought the incidence reeks of a foul play.
I can't help but really love the line that a more likely explanation to her than something as simple as a meteorite was that she was going insane!
I think she did see a plane on fire, but didn't know what to think anything at the time.
Well, you know how it is with a certain age group, Michael. They never have anything "normal." Headaches are a symptom of a brain tumor; an upset tummy is stomach cancer, etc., etc. It's all about melodrama and MEEEEE!!!! Yeah, they're ALL insane!
That is a lot to "see" and question whether or not it is really happening. Very descriptive for sudden bit of "losing my mind".
take enough thai drugs and yes, you'll think you're hallucinating when that eagle vision of yours sees a flaming plane that reads Malaysian Airlines on the underside of it.
yes, just like florida lotter winner, at convenience store someone else come up said I let her go first because she is old otherwise I will be a winner later that lady on the news want some piece of cake
Two other aircraft were with it? Sounds like one of those people that see Aliens but NEVER have a camera with them. Why didn't she? It's 2014!
The article states they were sailing across the Indian ocean, but the photo of the boat she is on is a motor boat.
Considering the state of journalism these days, I'm just glad they didn't show a train.
Stock photo pulled from a folder and attached to the story by someone that doesn't know the difference between a sailboat and a powerboat. You'd think the lack of a mast or masts and rigging would be a dead give away
@TimE....are you that stupid that you can't tell that it's a model and not a real boat. You said, "the photo of the boat she is on," just proves that you're an idiot. She is not on that boat. Take a closer look at the photo and tell me what you see. Moron.
Much attention has been focused on the seas and oceans in the search for Malaysia flight 370. Has someone thought of looking at the bushes and the jungle, Malaysia has a tropical climate which makes the trees grow big forming a canopy. A reconnaissance plane should go over the bushes and jungle to see if the plane crashed into the jungle. If that turns out to be the case, the searchers might have been pursuing the shadow instead of the substance. If found in the jungle, it is likely the survivors by now might have died because too much effort was devoted to sea search instead of including the land too. It is worth trying.
At first that would have been a good though but they know the airline did that wired flight path because of sensors on the opposite side of the island. It would mean that after whatever happened to put it off-course it would have had to make another u-turn
This woman should be shot for either perpetrating a attraction seeking stunt, or being willfully and persistently stupid for the last 2 MONTHS. well, at least she "feels bad!"
Something really really stinks about this aircraft " missing" Somebody knows something somewhere Does anybody else get the feeling that "they" are hiding what really happened ? I would not doubt they shot it down ( some countries military ) and don't want to have to admit it. Just pay out the insurance .....wich is what they would have to do anyway whether it is found or not. It makes sense because they were stumbling in the beginning. Almost like they were buying time to come up with the best lie they could and stall. Imagine having to admit you shot down all those people by accident or for some other reason
absolutely!! they know where it is
Ernst Stavros Blofield is at it again.
Very generic "rock boy". Who are "they"? Why are "they" hiding info? "Somebody knows something somewhere", yeah, this hammered trophy wife sailing across the Indiano Ocean saw it on fire in the sky. What else do you want to know?
I heard Elvis was on the plane.
Generic ? If I knew who " they " were. There would be no story or missing plane would there. Idiot : )
Must be a retired American government worker. They aren't very smart.
Well - I wasn't going to say anything - BUT: I was taking a leisurely bath in central Kansas, when I caught a flicker of light out of the corner of my eye through the window. Considering the date and time, I now think back "COULD that have been Malaysian air flight MH370??" Who knows for sure? It may have been the doomed jetliner, or it could have been the reflection of somebody's headlights as they turned the corner onto my street... I still wonder to this day.
Are you certain it wasn't Dorothy's house?
The terrorist pilots hijacked the plane and they cannot fly it to USA for another 911 so their next target is a Muslim killing country India.If some one fly to the east side of India without proper addressing they may shot it down because east side of India has more nuclear power plants,Nuclear submarine docking stations,visakapattanam nuclear sub building ports,wheeler island intercontinental ballistic missile launching pad and many more.who knows?
When I saw it the other day, I am pretty sure that Elvis was flying it and JFK was the co-pilot.
Don't be an idiot. Santa Claus was flying it and Jesus Christ was the co-pilot.
Sorry Jack. Santa Claus was yesterday! Today was Elvis! My bottle of Grey Goose never lies.
One evening I was out for a stroll and two large crows began following me, in an unusually menacing way. They were speaking to each other in a language I did not understand as they maintained steady cruising altitude about 3 meters above my head. Recognizing what appeared to be a very dangerous situation, and not having the faintest clue why I was their apparent target, I took evasive action. However, they followed me into the cinema, where I took refuge. There they landed on the popcorn machine and began ridiculing me in heavily accented English. Their laughter suddenly stopped and was replaced with the most grotesque and fearsome threats I had ever heard. I looked in vain for some authority figure to whom I could report these dangerous crows. I found no one. I was all alone with these agents of evil. My mind raced. Who were they? Who sent them? Why did anyone want me dead? Are crows edible? Can they read? Why are they eating the popcorn? That's for people. My thoughts swirled about in a racing, unforgiving and tortuous loop. As imminent death stared me down in the form of four tiny black eyes, I suddenly remembered that I had an early morning and therefore would need to wake up soon if I was to be timely for my first appointment. The remainder of my day was fine.
Well done. Write a book - of some kind. It's refreshing to read a comment written by someone that actually knows how to write.
Wow, your husband must have really been taking a mean #$%$ at the time! (seeing as he COMPLETELY MISSED a burning commercial jet airliner careening through the night sky, while on a boat in the middle of the open ocean, and only you happened to see it)
There have been multipla reports of the plane flying low and being trailed by two military looking aircrafts. This story isn't new, but is also not one that the powers that be will investigate or comment on until they can get their alibis in order.
She saw it in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time. The article headline says “Woman claims she saw missing Malaysian air flight while sailing in Indian Ocean.” The boat model shows someone at the wheel and another figure sitting up front while the video says she was alone on night watch. (Sounds like she had no business on night watch when you read her comments) Where was her husband at the time of her sighting and was she drinking as well? She must not keep up with world events or all of sudden it dawned on her what she believes she witnessed might have been the missing airliner month’s earlier, talk about slow recall... She thought she might have been going insane or she thought she was hallucinating, once again, what was she drinking? She made no mention whether she thought it crashed into the ocean and appears to lack self confidence and her statements lack any value, just like all of the news coming from the Malaysian government.
@OneSTUPIDOpinion... Maybe she was actually ENJOYING her life, cruising, with her hubby in the middle of the ocean, without a care in the world, at least during this cruise. How ODD/WEIRD/STRANGE for a plane to be out in the middle of the ocean. As she said, she dismissed it as a mirage/signs of insanity. Nobody expected her to scour the news when she got back to on dry land. She never had to say a word. Hopefully officials use her information to aid the investigation. Lady deserves no criticism
The boat model is also not a sailing vessel.
Onestupidopinion, are you saying that her comments don't make sense in light of the picture that is being shown. If so, she doesn't really have any control of that. That would be the media outlet that controls that.
The picture is an artistic recreation from comments made by a women who also said she did not believe her eyes, she thought she was hallucinating, I questioned my mind, it did occur to me it might be a meterorite, more likely that I was going insane.....you are entitled to your opinion too. Are you saying what she said is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?
No one is saying that what she said was true or accurate. My point is that you can tell someone something, but you have no control over whether the person relays that information correctly to someone else. The news media doesn't always report things accurately that are told to them or the way it is told to them. She apparently told them that she was the only one on night watch. She doesn't have control, however, of whether or not their model accurately represents what she told them. The news media chose the model that was used to go along with the story. I even saw a news story once that had the wrong picture linked to a story. They had picture from one story linked to a completely different story. The news media makes mistakes, just like anyone else.
She says she thought she was hallucinating,seeing things or going insane.. WTH??? kind of self evaluation is that? Sorry, but something just isn't right about this or her or that or anything described in this article
Her "information" couldn't be any worse than what the government of Malaysia thought they had. At least hers was free.
The plane is probably in another dimension or in a prehistoric forest full of dinosaurs or maybe on a planet millions of light years away we will never know.
I saw a dinosaur in my back yard last week.
because of the amount of cover up, I believe this plane was shot down by the Malaysian government in an apparent attempt to stop the plane from going off course. if her story was true it would explain the two other planes(fighter jets).
The only place authorities haven't looked for the plane is under the giant cover-up.
BS. Just another person looking for publicity.
"British woman Katherine Tee is saying she spotted what she believes is the missing Malaysian Air flight MH370 while she was sailing." They also 'see' royalty in their inbred 'Windsors'.... observe.... a picture of 'Prince' Charles... - What a hoot ! He's 'next' - they don't even get a 'chance' to vote ! ! This 'story' will now develop into a new PC term for Bull Scat... "Kay-Tee" ! - As in - this story is pure Kay-Tee !
The picture of the boat shown is not a sailing vessel. And if you see what she said she saw you are bound by Maritime law to radio. If a ship does not catch your transmission chances are a plane will. There is lots of sea traffic in the area she is talking about. How on earth someone could not report this is beyond me. Sounds like a fish story to me. Or else someone who should not be sailing. And where does her husband weigh in on this? If this story is true they should loose their sailing qualification, if they have one. God help those who would expect help if there was an emergency at sea from those two.
It's not even a real picture and as far as a sailing qualification there are many like me who have been sailing all their life without taking any courses so a qualification means nothing except you have a piece of paper. I certainly would have logged it and reported by radio as is required. People have driver licenses yet don't follow good driving principals. I suspect a fish story as well.
That's not a real boat, nimrod.
What up with the picture of the prop driven plane! The missing aircraft is a commercial jet.
where is the pic you talk about, only see jet plane in video
Looks like they removed the original pic when they realized their screw up! Its gone now, unless like the woman we were all hallucinating.
The point here is the woman has contacted authorities, she didn't take a freaking photo. Amazing mentallity here, simply amazing.
too many morons here, time to go.
Don't go Albert, we will miss our village idiot!
Amazing what people will do for their 15 minutes of shame! :O
If it wasn’t such a tragic event we could all freely laugh with great gusto at the mainstream media regarding the disappearance of Malaysian flight 370. Every single source, substantiated or not, was taken as a great revelation. It was and continues to be a sad circus of events. If those following the serious clues left available there is only one question to ask. Why does no one mention the Indian Ocean's most advanced and secure air base, the stationary Aircraft Carrier located south of the southern tip of India called Diego Garcia? Not a peep. Not even an indication of a US managed military installation that monitors everything in this war region. In fact the best old metaphor regarding the lack of reference to this location is “The Silence Is Deafening.” So here it is. As CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CBC, BBC, CTV and all the rest are prepared to spout off theories without any solid confirmation, here is one from a source who wishes to remain unidentified from Northwest BC Canada. This individual comes from a three decade long background of exposing the secrets the one percent and the military forces would rather have remained secret. He has recently revealed what happened to flight 370. ‘Film at Eleven’. Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah prepared and practiced with his home flight simulator and had determined the maximum speed and angle of decent the Boeing 777 could withstand. As soon as the flight reached the extent of the Malaysian radar capability, when he knew they would no longer expect to see his radar signal, he wished the ground crews good night. He then turned off one tracking device, waited to see if anyone responded or raised alarm for 15 minutes, then turned off all communication devices. He locked the cabin door to prevent anyone from entering after asking his co-pilot to get him a drink or check on a system outside of the cockpit. The Captain then immediately turned the plane southwest into a know flight path and climbed to over 40,000 ft. the maximum structural capability of the Boeing 777. He put on the pilot supplied air mask and kept the plane at over 40,000 ft until he was certain all the passengers and crew, including his co-pilot, were asphyxiated. From his flight simulator experimentation he had already determined the precise coordinates where he would initiate his next action. To bring the plane down at the maximum speed and maximum angle of decent to make a direct hit on the fuel storage tanks at Diego Garcia. As he initiated this direct course of action the American Military had not been concerned with the radar blip of this flight at 40,000 plus feet. They monitor vessels and flights which appear to be a threat or are invading their space. However they were suddenly brought into complete attention as their warning systems set off alarms. The base at Diego Garcia attempted to make radio contact and immediately dispatching interceptors. Knowing full well this was an imminent threat, having no time to debate the issue and recognizing the aircraft was operating in what was basically ‘stealth’ mode, uncommunicative, the plane was shot out of the sky. Becoming aware of which flight it was with the political and potential military repercussions, the US military ordered a complete lock down on all communications regarding the event and began dispatching crews to locate and pick up all the debris. When the rest of the world became aware the flight was missing the US Navy offered all their resource to help them look for it in the South China Sea, then the Gulf of Thailand, Bay of Bengal and the Strait of Malacca. This kept the worlds attention focused away from the location they were cleaning up. US 7th Fleet Commander William Marks told CNN “We wait for the Malaysians to tell us where to search and we go there.” This is the most telling statement of all. Since when does the US take directions from Malaysia unless they are simply providing the rope to let them hang themselves. The most powerful radar systems in the region are at Diego Garcia. A perfect target for such an attack, one the USA stopped and one they simply cannot reveal to the world due to the nationality of the passengers on board. They will continue to assist in the search while doing everything to ensure no one even mentions Diego Garcia in the mainstream media.
As good a theory as any other. I, too believe there is no way this plane just "disappeared" but for us or any other country to tell what they know would reveal the capabilities and the extent of surveillance in place.
I love it! Quit wasting time on the BS page and start (and finish) a novel.
some good points.....but a little to "Alex Jones" for me, but good points none the less
Pure silliness and conspiracy laden theory. Just silly.
Dude, what are you smoking because I want some!
Drinking I think. Whiskey maybe! Overdose? Yes!~
and the whole thing of it is, it is not america's responsibility to be the big bully in directing other nations on what and how to do things when planes are not in american airspace or not intending on landing in american controlled airports. this was not a american aircraft, so, as the countries started to communicate, it took time for their govts to cooperate. since there is no verifiable means to validate this story of the sailors, nor that of the secret canadian guy who knows people/events at garcia, the mistery continues. let me say this, if the sailor lady seen orange and black high up in the air, as if the plane was on fire, then in very high probability, the us airforce did not shoot it down at such a high altitude. since the surface to air rockets batteries may or may not exist at garcia, she would have seen them fire the rocket(s) and them leaving smoke contrails enroute upwards to such a high flying aircraft, and not just notice a single aircraft seemingly on fire.
And fuel storage tanks at a remote American base are a specifically desirable target, why?
My reply to "RM" WOW!!!!!!! Why was this not made into a movie. You blew my mind away.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Even tho us gov't woulda crowed to the heavens for stoppin a terrorist attack on domestic soil, the nature of a civilian foreign airliner being shot down would keep us quiet. Yes the silence says it all. Very plausible.
Well the pilot was a Muslim, and the base at Diego Garcia has been used to store, refuel, and lead off on attacks in the Middle East, so why would the fuel storage tanks not be a good Muslim suicide terrorist attack target? The source from Canada may very well have his facts straight.
rockets fired at night leave a distinct trail that is not mistakable, and if they were not noticed, as well as the major fireball explosions when they hit any object at 44000-47000 or so feet in the air, that should be visiable for 600 miles against a pitch dark sky, looking like a shooting star comming into the atmosphere, well, the conspiracy theorists will still have a field day because big foot cannot swim the entire indian ocean, at least i think he cannot, but i can be wrong.
listen radar monitors everything, and the transponders in the nose of the aircraft send signals, the transponders had to be turned off for the plane to just disappear, fire or terrorism not to mention mechanical failure - if the rest of the plane was still sending maintenance signals to the sats. a highjacked aircraft with a fight in the cockpit, going nose down into the drink is the most plausable, after the communications were disabled, just like on 9/11
I saw it too. I was in my bathroom just getting ready to dominate one and I saw it out my window.
She is so full if #$%$ that I would imagine that her eyes are brown. A plane of that size does not go down without some debris surfacing somewhere, period. It is more likely that the plane was flown to another country and has been re-painted, re-numbered, transponders removed and refitted for some evil plan.
oh yes what drugs did she smoke
look at the boat pictured in this story ... it's remote controlled ... maybe she has never sailed beyond her bathtub?
I doubt it but you certainly are a speculator, Derp.
.... only when she goes insane....
@Kola: from the article, "She thought she was hallucinating..."
The end of humanity is much more near than people are aware, the elites have already planned what will be in the near future. Propaganda through their media,and governments will keep the majority of mankind in the dark until it is too late to stop them. Those who already know the truth are prepared and ready to watch humanity destroy themselves,and will be the ones to inherit this earth and all that is in it. Through peace and understanding the earth will be renewed without the brainwashed ,uneducated,material minded greed driven zombies that the elites have created through their deceptions and lies with their religions and governments that blind all to the truth of who we are as creations of a living force some call GOD.
And I'm sure she sees Obama in her Hershey bar too.
Does anyone really believe this woman? Planes are seen everywhere & she didn't say anything about seeing the missing plane until now, while the rest of the world has been looking for it? If you see a plane on fire it's only common sense that you should report it to the authorities.
She's a long distance sailor, she is in a completely different world.
YES, WE SHOT IT DOWN BEFORE IT COULD REACH DIEGO GARCIA WITH THE NUKE ON BOARD. THE SAGA OF THE NUKE RECOVERY WILL MAKE A GREAT TV SPECIAL.
"British woman Katherine Tee" obviously saw no plane. She didn't come up with her story in March when the supposed sighting occurred because at that point everybody assumed the plane would be found within days, so her fib would have been exposed and she might have gotten herself into a legal trouble for misleading the searchers. Now, that the search has been all but abandoned, "British woman Katherine Tee" thought the time had come for her 15 minutes of fame and maybe a small check or two from a couple of low-brow news outlets.
Hold your horses, on the 4th day I guessed the plane from its last known position was from the Andaman sea, after it passed over southern Thailand, I predicted it took a right tern and went up the center of the "Sea of Bengal" (however all the experts say it took a left turn and ended up in the ocean wasteland off the coast of Austrailia and run out of gas.) I have figured the plane had enough gas to land in northern Pakistan or southern Iran, if my predictions are right it could very well have intersected with someone making passage from India to Thailand across the indian ocean, that is below the Sea of Bangal, look at the world atlas,I think this woman is more credible than anyone, I also think someone knew there was a big screw up, especially those in the two smaller planes, probably military.
So if the plane is in Pakistan, when is it going to turn up?
So is it the left tern or the right tern?
The military (whose ever they were) shot the plane down because it was in the wrong air space. She probably did see something going on and no one will admit to it. Deep down I always had thought it is somewhere on land being kept for Lord knows what later on. Why hasn't anyone even checked over land is beyond me.
Underwater microphones indicate it went down 2300nm NW of present search area. That would be from DG to Pakistan. No one has said what FL it was at.
@MALCOM, I am going to predict your an a hole.
Amos, you cna't predict what's already happened...Malcolm has already proven to be an a hole, so hindsight is 20/20!
until they find it I'm sticking w/ "the aliens took it" theory.
Hey Malcom. Knock, Knock. She said the plane was on fire...trailing black smoke and you think it landed somewhere a thousand miles away? What are you smoking?
I don't value some #$%$'s opinion who thinks she sees a fireball of a plane in the sky and thinks I'm so ditzy it must not have been real. Earlier an article said she was having marital problems and that's why she didn't report it. Either way, it sounds like someone who only thinks of themselves and now is waiting for her 15 minutes of fame. I am aso sure CNN, MSNBC, GMA and Today will give it to her. Idiots.
Yeah she's "standing watch" but thinks what she sees is a mirage
I thought I'd heard it all concerning this plane, and then she comes along with her "hallucination" story. This is so ridiculous, I can't even believe we're hearing about this.
@Bill...has anyone ever told you you're an idiot? If they haven't, I will. You're an idiot. From now on you need to wear a big I on your forehead so everyone knows you're an idiot. I bet you embarrass your family everyday from the stupid things you say.
So 3 months later she finally believes her eyes?
after reading some of these comments no wonder the woman was afraid to say anything.
Aliens were in the other crafts. They disabled the plane with phasers and then teleported all the people out, replacing them with lifeless doubles, just in case the wreckage was ever discovered. Kris Kristofferson will figure it out once he gets on the case.
I would give it to Tom Selleck.
How could she see it if it was missing? Sometimes I don't understand headlines.
you dont understand because you are reading it wrong. the plane wasnt reported missing when she saw it, it is known as the missing plane AFTER THE FACT.
More bunk designed to keep people from remembering that the plane turned completely around (something that only a trained pilot with the right numerical sequence can do) and that 2 of the passengers had stolen passports. It's how they prevent a religious war.
Does this fit my suspicion from the beginning: The plane was hijacked and shot down by someone's military...India, the US? Therefore, the concerted obfuscation.
One of the planes flying the other way were piloted by Amelia Earhart with navigator Fred Noonan.
Who dat? The Earhart Flight initiated in New Orleans ironically.
I meant, That's a good one.
I just got off the phone with DB Cooper and he says you're way wrong Paul.
Hope ol' DB gave you an autographed bill from the cash he absconded with that fateful day.
Was this woman eating mushrooms or drinking seawater?
Hope it was mushrooms - much more fun!
Nothing but idiots out there, this woman is a fool!
That was what I said in the beginning of this incident, that the government of Malaysia was covering up the incident for something or somebody; now it looks like they are covering up for the incompetence of their own Air Force, which may have shoot down the plane. I am sure in some twenty or thirty years later, someone who was one of those pilots will confessed of the shooting down of their own country's Jet Liner plane by air to air missile.
I doubt any of the shooters are still alive
She is just saying anything to see her name in the paper. If she really saw anything, wouldn't her husband insist on calling the authorities? She is nuts for not doing it sooner. Or was she just dreaming her story up. We may never know the truth.
Seriously? Someone ran this story as news?
news flash, i was taking a bath, sailing my toy boat. i thought i saw off in the distance, a burning plane. smoke, and other planes with it. tmz, please pay me for my story. and i am sorry i completed my bath before reporting this
British? Sailing in the middle of nowhere with her husband? She was on ecstasy, cocaine and pot no doubt. And you trust what she saw was real?? Go back to Birmingham baby
Have you ever met a Brit sailor who wasn't intoxicated with rum and whiskey? This broad been drinkin the juice and seeing things. The Malaysian plane was captured by people from Mars. I would caution all tonight before you go to sleep look under your bed and inside closets, in the attics etc and make certain there ain't no "Little Green Mudderfurqers" hiding there. Barstard martians are fuqqin with us earthlings. The world's coming to to an end when you find sober British sailors on the high sea.
I've never met a British sailor, but I'll certainly take your advice and inspect my place thoroughly for Martians before I go to bed tonight.
Those little green #$%$. I thought they all went home. They still hanging around down here? Heck guess I am going to have to start looking under my bed again. Thanks for the heads up.
I just don't understand, with todays technology - how can they NOT find this plane??? It really does sound like a conspiracy. It reminds me of Area 51 in Roswell NM. Someone, somewhere knows the truth.
"They", as all the agencies who have been "searching" for this missing aircraft. If NASA can spot craters on Mars and some new Ancient Planet, why can't someone find this plane?
Her tinfoil hat made the flames appear closer than they really were.
Leaving out the insanity question, it would be nice to know if she marked her location or put in a marker on her Loran or somehow or other is able to give some reference to the authorities as to where she may have seen the flaming plane.
Amazing! And I saw Bigfoot last summer but didn't say anything because I figured no one would believe me
Oh, you were in Wisconsin too? Because Bigfoot stayed with me in the cabin last summer. He makes the best iced tea.
You didn't see Bigfoot, you saw a meteorite. They sometimes look just like Bigfoot in the night sky.
Bill O'Reilly just issued a Press Release through Fox, he will Personally cover this 24/7 for then next 4 Months, he setting up a Command Center now, Maygn Kelly will join him on Occasion as she can, with Geraldo following up as well, Glad to see there will be Honest Coverage
Well now, this is interesting. I'd be curious to know if it was a clear night in that area of the sea on that time and date. I usually don't jump on the conspiracy band-wagon, but the fact that there were Chinese scientists on board who were about to patent something worth millions, this may not be too far-fetched..
It probably got hijacked, because the cabin (with pilot and co-pilot) can be sealed from the rest of the aircraft, then you gas everyone in the seats, kill the pilot or co-pilot, use manual shut-up for the pinging device, and fly low under radar up to china, or some other county. Not that hard to do if you have a plan. Then you simply repaint it and use it for domestic violence...crash it into some countries embassy after filling it with explosives, and making the paint job appear american or something.
@linda, "manual shut-up" ????? Is that a technical term for a device or procedure on a Boeing plane? Have you tried to contact Boeing about this "shut-up" claim?? I think Boeing would probably tell you to shut the F up!! ALL of you conspiracy theory idiots really make me laugh out loud. Thanks for the laugh.
Wow - what a novel idea! Surprised no one thought of that before today!
Another clue leading to a clue that is another clue's clue.
She was sailing. So why does the article include a picture of a sport powerboat?
Should b easy to prove or disapprove. Two other planes? Given the approximately location of boat . Checks ffa records of flight plans and corsets of jet liner. Have they searched that area ? And get statement from husband
Author Nigel Cawthorne just wrote a book about MH370. He said it was shot down during a joint Thai-US military training exercise where "there was a series of war games taking place in the South China Sea involving Thailand, the US and personnel from China, Japan, Indonesia and others."
And I saw Hoffa a few years ago but never said anything because I couldn't believe my eyes. If anybody is interested I am up for interviews and a book deal.
I saw him too, having vodka martinis with Elvis, last year, in Mazatlan.
all the people that are doubting her claims, ask yourself what she gets out of making this reported possible sighting? absolutely nothing. its not like she's looking for a book deal, she even questions her own sanity. So take it what it is, another person coming forward claiming that they think they may have seen the flight and want to relieve the feeling of guilt they are carrying for not reporting sooner. That's all this is... get over your judgmental ego and if anything a simple thank you for reporting your story and take it how you will.
@liz How many more planes flew over her while she was sailing. How did she know it was that one? COME ON
sure she does. she gets a news article on yahoo for all us people to read. that in itself is enough for her! she can tell all her friends and family she was published. she if full of #$%$!
Lier, Lier, pants on fire. This woman's story is as fake as they come and all she is doing is looking for news media time. She needs a shrink not the media. No one and I mean no one holds back that kind of info, knowing what has happen to flight MH370. It was world news, so she cannot say she didn't know. Her statement, "I chose to sweep it under the carpet" is pathetic and she is a lier, you just don't do that.
Lier lier??? Really? You cant spell liar?
I believe her story because the fishermen also did see something burning few weeks after MH370 was reported missing. The fire must have started on cargo bay area that carried lithium batteries and they exploded into flame..
The plane flew around for weeks burning
Such #$%$...making us jump to the idea that it was probably shot down or kept secret. Anyways how the hell do you see black smoke in the middle of the night?
Well, if there was a moon it would have reflected enough light to see the smoke.
Out at sea the sky is so different than on populated land. It is brilliant with stars, one could see what would look like dark clouds following the jet if this were true. So yes it is possible. I have sailed out at sea and have seen the sky even without a full moon. I am not saying that what she says is true or not true but you can see quite a bit at night out at sea.
a lot of these comments question her sincerity BUT it's the best explanation I've heard yet. it certainly beats anything that the Malaysian gov't has come out with. of course she's insane---no one would sail those waters alone---that area is very dangerous.
What a total load of BS nonsense. Anyone who buys even 1/10th ot this should have their head examined. What sane person would experience that and not tell anyone? NO ONE IS WHO !!!
all along, I thought someone shot down that plane when it went off course and into air space it should be in - of course that country won't own up to it - it would be an international incident.
A story like that could be verified if an intersection of two plane routes around the time and the location of the woman observation can be found. Further, if such two planes are found, anyone that was aboard should be questioned.
Why should they be questioned? Any normal person seeing a plane go down would tell people about it! It is obvious this woman is nuts, or just looking for her 15 minutes of fame.
You people are insane. What if she is telling the truth. Instead of just listening to what she says, your minds automatically go to why she is a liar. Incredible. I'm sure if you were a family member, at the very least you would want to check the occurence of 2 airlines flying within range of one another on the night in question in the vicinity of where she was sailing. I read two pages of comment and they were all negative. Idc if shes lying. People disregarding peoples claims are why ppl stay missing, or are killed. She definitely should have said something but you have no idea about her mind. Maybe she is like you all and doubt what she sees.
Dexter... Yea... If I were a family member, I probably would grasp at a straw like this. But, I'm not. I'm a guy on a message board... And, like everyone else here, we're just expressing opinions and no rescue operations are depending on our comments for input. I'm sure her claim, credible or not, will be followed up. Any competent person in charge would do that.
Maybe she did maybe she didn't, but it has been awhile and this is the first I've heard of her story. I think she is just after attention.
The only logical conclusion is that plane was raptured and the rest of us were left behind to live out our days in the end times!
Compare all anomalies associated with the secret Diego Garcia base, and draw your own conclusions. This isn't the first plane whose crash was not any accident. Also look up Rodney Stich and suspicious aircraft accidents. Once you become a truth junkie, TV will never hold you in its sway again. Learn IT/Internet security so you don't get put on any list for asking such silly questions of Google.
Congratulations Mrs. Katherine Tee, mission accomplished. You gained your 5 minutes of fame. As so many families, friends and other acquaintances are grieving and by all means come to an understanding. Then many professional are frustrated and baffled. Here you are presenting truth as you see it. Not in any way contributing to a solution but rather rehashing all the problems by cutting and pasting from all the coverage of the story. How selfish and self centered preying on such an unfortunate set of events to feed your need for attention. I find it utterly disgusting but as I started off again I say congratulations because regardless to how I may feel you accomplished a goal.
hello!!!! she's British....not American. ....................................... we aim for 15 minutes
And that was only 5 years after she sailed the Atlantic and realized she saw the Titanic sinking, and then later on, in the Pacific, also witnessed Amelia's plane making a cool landing and waving happily at her.
If there's any truth to her story, she should be worried about her own safety now. Whatever gov't is responsible if going to be looking to take them out.
What? No pictures or video? Who doesn't have a cellphone with such capabilities in todays day and age???
One more misdirection. Now that she has had plenty of time to rehearse. She would have known immediately after seeing the news 3 months ago, but only now saying something? The only logical answer is that a military or government 'something' happened. Not terrorists, because they brag almost immediately. I still vote for 1 of these 3: 1 - that an advanced weapon was tested on the plane. 2 - there were some people that needed disappearing. 3 - a mysterious cargo was on board needing to have the plane disappear to acquire said cargo. There is no way with today's tech that a plane that big just disappears and nobody anywhere has a single clue. All those 'searches' are just fronts to mislead and buy time for people to forget about the whole thing.
Have you considered writing a novel?
It meant to be thumbs up. I must agree. The government is behind this and in due time the families will have moved on but never will they forget.
If it soft landed in the ocean and sank intact there would be little or no debris and be very very very hard to find even with advanced technology. Remember it took 2 years to find the airbus flight that went down in the ocean and they had debris and a rough location based on the beacon.
I know ... a plane disappeared into the ocean with the people on board. No conspiracy no cover up. A plane crashed in a remote part of the Indian Ocean .... people died. End of story. Now put down the spray paint and the paper bag and get on with your life.
@B A - You really need to educate yourself. Even Google Maps has eyes on everything. Do you truly believe that every single flight everywhere is not electronically monitored, with a few fail-safes at that? And if someone 'turned off' the monitoring, then go back to my list of 3 options. There is no way any plane loaded with people simply disappears anywhere my friend. And then have so many wild goose chases with so called 'new information'? Just go back to my list of 3 options.
Wake it still takes years to complete a satellite survey. It is imppossible for Google maps to have eyes on everything. When I useGoogle maps and and zoom in on my house I can tell by the veichels setting there that it is at least 5 years old. It would take millions os satellites to do what you say with current technology.
Sounds goofy but with so many lives lost and families involved , every lead needs to be taken seriously and explored. Who knows.
Alert CNN to warm up the simulator.
Is it possible that this plane is somewhere in the middle east being fitted with a nuke to spread the ultimate carnage?
I read an earlier report by fisherman that said they seen a plane on fire. Looks like the aircraft manufacturer may be to blame. Battery fire or whatever.
And what about the Vietnamese guy who saw a plane in flames over the water between Malaysia and VietNam? It would be astounding if in fact they have been looking at the wrong place all this time!
I suspect they have been looking in the wrong place, which explains why nothing has been found. It's in the water somewhere.
Some nation's air force shot down this plane and all the delays in providing information gave the authorities enough time to spin it.
The Chinese Air Force? or Casper the Friendly Ghost put a curse on it and made the engines stop running..
Yes, several countries, all of whom hate each others' existence on the face of the earth conspired to shoot down and cover up the shooting down of a passenger airline over another country's airspace. Makes perfect sense.
Casper would never do anything so despicable.
This woman sounds like a nutcase looking for attention. Her story does not add up. An obvious attention-seeking idiot,
man everybody done saw something why wasn't all this reported before now people need to realize they are playing on other peoples loses so I wish all speculation stuff will stop from both sides tell us something when there is something to tell that is helpful those families are ia a tense moment now they have lost their love ones
Just another (self-proclaimed) loon seeking her 15 minutes of fame. The plane is in Pakistan. Period.
Sounds like somebody found a way to get attention for her self.
Well, what direction was it going, and did the other planes report it? And what part of the Indian Ocean was it, compared to where observers think it went down? And does her husband back her up? Waiting...mystery writer!!!
The only newsworthy element of this story is that anyone is bothering to publish it.
Sure hope that someone follows up. It would be a relief for everyone to know the truth and bring this to a close. Benghazi is a similar story in that the truth will eventually come out and it can't be just forgotten or hid.
I saw Elvis at an Olive Garden. He was sitting with Jim Morrison.
Me too! I was doing shrooms and saw this cool lite fly by. Turned out it was just my friend with a bong. I'd have reported it earlier, but later that evening, we were arrested and I just got out of jail.
I saw unicorns last week too!
IF, she is correct then one could surmise that someone's military shot it down for whatever reason. Why did she think she was hallucinating? Has she had hallucinations previously? Interesting material for the goofy media.
This story has more holes in it than Swiss cheese. She thought she was hallucinating, An elongated plane with orange lights and smoke coming from it, She questioned her mind, it might be a meteorite, likely that she was going insane. It doesn't take a seasoned detective to realize that there's a fabrication going on and probably for her 15 seconds of fame. Well there it is lady, enjoy the talk shows that love this type of nonsense where you can feel important for awhile and make a little money.
well who do you think you are? does bad mouthing women on the internet make you feel like a big shot? maybe this will make you "feel important..."
no frackin kidding! Even if she thought that she was crazy that night, how could it NOT occur to her to mention this after ALL of the hullabaloo raised about this plane the subsequent month following the crash?
Ya she also spotted the elusive water snuffalupagus while out on her ocean jaunt!
Its like 3 months later, why would anyone even report this? Thats what I call irresponsible journalism.
Waiting this long doesn't make any sense since they were asking for anyone with any information. Makes you wonder.
The only 'insane' part about this is her inclination to label herself insane, merely because she'd seen something never witnessed before. If this doesn't showcase the power of programmed thinking, I don't know what does.
"I saw a plane on fire and thought I was seeing things, and didn't make the connection to the missing plane, even though I saw it on the night it disappeared, and in the same area." Uh, yeah. I don't think so. Nice try at your 15 minutes of fame, though.
There were some fishermen that seen it too.Their claims were dismissed also,and they reported it the next day.
Somebody wants attention. Isn't it weird that she could see black smoke behind an airplane at night? Weird.
In this case eye witnesses' stories might be more reliable than detected pings because all those pings thought to be related to the plane turned out to be unrelated and... what are the odds that someone sees a plane with orange glow and black smoke in the sky?
Lay off the mushrooms lady. Another whack job looking for some attention. Well, maybe the other two planes were fighter jets that shot down the airliner? I am sure someone will start that conspiracy theory in short.
Maybe you should lay off the supercilious thinking there johns, ever been to sea for weeks or months at a time? Shooting stars are everywhere and the sky is full of stars, I can definitely understand someone not being sure of themselves with something like that.
I am going to call no goal on this. Headline grab is all it is especially saying there were two other planes near it. Have another Mai-Tia.
CNN is going to do a 2 hour special on the women's claims. They will re-do the set to show what she saw...LIVE with an actual breakdown.
Yeah, and maybe they will have the two airplane guys in a sailboat simulator in nighttime conditions in the Indian Ocean. Funny post "d".
They should sail around the horn of Africa, I hear it's beautiful this time of year.
well to be honest , i doubt if there was a plane that went down in the ocean. cause if it did go down i am sure they would find it by now. or just out there wanting people to believe it went down . yes there is something very very wrong with this story and the plane to. i think it is a cover up or something or some one or more just wanted to be in the news. with all this techo stuff we have so on and so forth whomever is looking for it maybe did find it and not want it to be known for some unknown reason. well some day the truth will known. and to about a lot of other stuff that is for sure....
is CNN still running 24x7 coverage and ignoring all the Obama scandals?
I don't believe nothing she is telling , if this is true why has she waiting tell now to tell anyone now , cause they ask for help and needed ever clue back in March they could get . Some people will tell anything just get attention .
Sadly, This news is just more pain and overwhelming grief and heartache for the families of the passengers of Air flight MH370…Keep Praying at this time for Peace, and Help for the families and loved ones, and friends left behind, -Amen.
Coming down in flames? Hmm, that sounds odd, but nothing in this tragedy surprises me. Hopefully the plane will be found someday.
It sounds like she wanted to get her name in the paper, in realtiy she said absolutely nothing that would help find the airplane. Seems to me a real sailor would have checked their GPS at that time and made a note of it ,furthermore if that airplane was indeed on fire, they should have stopped moving and follow the aircraft with Binoculars.
Tee also claimed on the same night that she spotted what looked like Obama reading from a floating teleprompter while walking on the water and commanding the rise in the ocean to slow and the planet to heal.
I saw an interesting theory on this yesterday. I'm not saying I believe it but it was interesting. Apparently the entire engineering team and 4 of the 5 patent holders for some new super advanced semiconductor were on that plane and the patent was going to be approved later that week. The 5th patent holder through the grapevine is Rothschild and since the others are missing and presumed dead before it was approved he becomes 100% owner of this patent. The hacker group Anonymous is claiming all of this... I'm not a conspiracy guy really but you never know.
Yes....thats been all over the news too.
The more of the possible truth starts to leak there will be more stories it being seen here and there we will most likley never get the truth just like everything else now days.
Clark I heard similar intell myself. I was told the plane was shot down. I had a sailor tell me he and members of his crew saw at least 2 missiles in flight over that area and the flash. We had 2 nuke subs in that area. So there is a reason that aircraft is not found... The sailor and crew were later interrogated and told to shut their mouths or face a deep dark hole in some south western desert.... I am assuming the aircraft were Chinese in origins... I believe it is all linked to their new aircraft carrier as well.... That's my conspiracy theory. The sailors I know don't tell fish stories...
I would love to see an enterprising journalist chase that story down, Clarkson. It wouldn't be the first time people have died in a crash to satisfy someone's greed. I hope it's not the truth. Such a horrible waste of life.
Patent ownership is proprietary...the partial ownership would be deferred to the family members...not the remaining member of patent ownership.
They covered that Mike. Only patents that have been approved are proprietary.
You have pierced the veil of truth !!!! Mao shall have his revenge on all who have not adhered to his "Little Black Chip". Oh, Lordy.
Gotta love all of this "conspiracy theories" Tim Yeakel now that is just a plain BS story.
Yes, strange how none of that's mentioned in the media huh?? The theory goes, the Plane was hijacked and flown below radar to Diego Garcia where it remains today. I suspect now that things have blown over we'll be getting "Mysterious" Reports about people seeing the plane going down in a certain area as the above report mentions (Strange how she didn't report this until now lol) and within the next month or so some fisherman will find the Debris maybe a Wing floating in an area that was never searched but they'll never find the actual bodies of the people on the plane. What's strange is that the Rothchilds have something to do with the Malaysia banks as well. Just another Billionaire that's gonna make Billions more.
Yet there is no proof of this super computer, no person or company (Rothchilds) coming forward claiming to have any patent no other information at all. Rumors are like the internet someone some where will believe anything and keep it going.
Of course anonymous a bunch of 5 year olds are talking about the big bad Jew family of Rothschild.
@Chumba Wamba. The media doesnt report anything of value anymore. You expect them to cover something like this? If there is any sliver of truth to it then of course CNN, NBC and all the other hacks in the media arent going to say anything. They are busy covering up Obama's scandals and reporting what kind of dress Kim Kardashian wore yesterday.
Rothschild runs the Bilderbergs. If you don`t know about them you might want to research them.
A Rothchild ? then we know what happened
So it was shot at by the 2 military planes... but whose?
wouldn't it be badass if they could somehow figure out where she was when she saw that plane on fire, and the search could be moved there and they actually found the plane? Wouldn't that be neat?
This woman is absolutely full of #$%$!
Impossible, CNN said it was a black hole.
Captain Morgan was at the helm and first mate Jack Daniels was manning the sails. Closure is over yonder above the blue horizon.She will be making a statement at the Neon Moon.
If Ms Tee didn't write down the GPS co-ordinates and report them to the authorities she is not only stupid - she is a fraud. Plus, any normal person would take pictures. Looking at the Yacht I assume she could afford a camera.
I would have reported that just so YAHOO would send some dumb a@@ reporter out to get my name and write a story about me and my boat.
So the plane was on fire when she saw it; funny a jet plane crashes in flames into the ocean and no parts, trash, bodies, suitcases, clothing, nothing washes up. That is about as believable as her story.
You do realize that she is talking about an area NO ONE has searched so far?
Hey, Mr. Exec. Something would have washed up somewhere.
Hey Independent no it would not have, pull up the map for that area and look at the current flow.
There are far more stupid statements on this article than usual and that is saying a lot. Too many TV's in southern trailers I guess.
For someone to keep saying they thought they were hallucinating or going insane usually means they've hallucinated or went insane before. All credibility goes out the window if you can't or won't trust what you see.
Too bad you called the authorities. Maybe it was made out of some precious metal and you let them have it.
Surprised it was not accompanied by a UFO rescuing the passengers.
This whole plane thing gets more insane each time a news story hits. I don't understand with everyone searching how wreckage was never found. I would like a story on how long wreckage would take to hit any land anywhere from all the various possible locations. Should people be finding any cushions or things from this flight along their beaches somewhere? Obviously no one has a clue where it is.
Yea, the "Plane Wreck That Was Never Found": the continuing saga of the US American Government in action.....
How often does this lady hallucinate that she can't distinct reality from hallucinations? I think her story is a stretch at best and complete bs if I had to make an assumption. I don't even know why this lady's story is being reported considering how ridiculous it sounds. What's next, a report of a kid who thinks there are monsters under the bed?
I bet if you had a yacht and sailed around the world you would hallucinate more than Snoopy.
She saw this at night? Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night, I can see paradise by the dashboard light.
lol, let me sleep on it.....
You also spotted a yeti while in India. Correct?
It would be pitch dark in the middle of the ocean at midnight (or thereabouts), so how did she black smoke?
SR, think of any film you have seen of a burning building that was taken at night. The flames illuminate the smoke in the immediate vicinity of the blaze. That may be what she saw.
Or the moon was out. Clouds can be seen at night as well.
no mention of moon, and if the plane was flying at even 15,000 ft (3miles up) in the dark unlike a building a 150ft away, you are not going to see smoke.
You have to know the CIA had there dirty little hands in this incident.
If her story is false, she's an idiot. If her story is true, she's still an idiot.
Most of the people that commented on this post have too much time on their hands. Myself included. I think my kids will better understand what happened
And exactly why was this claim turned into a Yahoo news story? The woman herself thought she was hallucinating! Maybe she was self-medicating...
What's weird is she also claimed to have seen Amelia Earhart's plane on fire and crash landing in Borneo.
To start with even the Apostles told the women they were crazy when they reported that Jesus had appeared to them, men have not changed in all these years, but the reports from the women were true and I believe we should listen to this one. The planes that were also in the area had to know so the authorities also know what happened.
"...But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Yes just like Sarah telling us where the plane went. What kind of idiot sees a burning plane fall into the ocean and knowing the whole world was looking for a plane that possibly fell into the ocean near there and not at least report her location to the authorities, oh an insane person. OTOH, look at how people are treated when they report UFOs here, or crimes to the cops, even by non-insane people so maybe best to shut up and stay out of it.
Well this supports my theory that China shot this plane down because of the suspected terrorists aboard.
So your first impression after seeing a plane on fire is to think you are either insane, or hallucinating. Interesting. However, once you got to land why didn't you report it? You had to know it was the top news story all over the world. Some people just have no class or empathy at all.
Obama and the regime were getting beat up over the VA thing last week They decided to release a bunch of terrorists in exchange for a deserter, hoping they would get lots of good press for that. Yeah, that kinda backfired. Look for some kind of disaster Saturday or Sunday to draw the attention of the press from the regime.
It was probably just the LSD she was on.
Indian Ocean? Are they allowed to say Indian?
The lady is obviously clueless in not knowing the difference between an airliner and a meteor. The plane never crashed, it's in a hangar somewhere awaiting it's real mission and who knows what that is.
I think I saw it too but there was a flying saucer attacking it. since I just had smoked a fatty I thought I was hallucinating too.
The "flight plan" did NOT go over the Indian Ocean. It was a flight to China that flew in the direction of Vietnam. Notice the video doesn't even show anything real. It's an ANIMATION. Reuters has been doing this sort of thing lately, I believe to spread disinfo. The story doesn't even tell you precisely where she was when she presumably saw it. Really bad disinfo.
Another person who wants her day on the Internet. It took her from then to now to believe her eyes?
I saw a cow jump over the moon once. Seriously. It was UTTER awesomeness.
If you were trying for the pun, UTTER should be UDDER.
She should have stuck with the insane conclusion.
I saw it from my basement in New Mexico...
She is an idiot and attention seeker.
I find this story somewhat hard to believe. Why did she wait so long to come forward when she knows that the world is watching and so many countries actively participating in an enormous search costing millions of dollars. Is this woman for real, is she seeking attention or is she simply hoping to get her 15 minutes of fame?
Not "SOME WHAT" she is not Believable in the slightest sounds like she had to much happy at Happy Hour, on that Yacht! PEOPLE ARE GULIABLE WHEN ITS AT OTHERS EXPENSE..... WHY DID THE AUTHOR OF THIS STORY EVEN PUT THIS OUT??? SAD THAT, THAT PERSON WOULD EVEN BOTHER TO WRITE THIS BS! I HOPE AND WISH THAT THESE FAMILIES EFFECTED DO SEE THIS........
I live in Anchorage and I can see Russia from here.
It was a Diego special forces military operation. Go look how many classified employees were on that plane and the projects they were working on.
KO, replay the Fox interview with General McInerny two nights in a row. He said the Boeing engineers received signals from those engines until they were turned off in Pakistan according to Pentagon Intelligence! The last two words could be an oxymoron.
What this woman said is not self promoting publicity stunt. To many people have no discernment at all! You, obnoxious brats, think everyone is like you!
The plane carried a shipment of explosive batteries! I was right away reminded of the jet that plummeted into the Everglades with a shipment of batteries. Boeing is having trouble with its battery system. I think that in the USA you now are restricted from carrying explosive batteries in passenger planes cargo holds. If not, it should be so!
The plane that crashed in Everglades had oxygen cannisters in cargo, which caught fire. This plane did also have LITHIUM batteries in their cargo space which have caught fire before on other flights. So you are correct about the 'explosive batteries', but this is also different than the problem with the Boeing 787 batteries , which arent part of their cargo but part of the plane itself .
Umm... she feels bad waiting (how long) before coming forward? Those that care about the passengers have been tormented over this (for how long again?), and she doesn't have the consideration to offer this (possibly) critical information? What a stupid and careless woman.
Congrats to Yahoo for using mental patients as reporters now.
Based on the eyewitness accounts, I'd surmise that it could have been a UFO abduction? Ms. Tee said as if there were two other planes above the ill-fated Malaysian Airline, which were moving in the other direction. Reports on alien encounters claimed that a UFO that is hovering over a certain vehicle could disable its electronic system. The same thing could have happened to the Malaysian Airline before it was lost in the Indian Ocean.
In March I did a concentration and got that MH370 was 3,700 NW of takeoff point. I reported it several times as comments. I hope the plane is found.
has ANYBODY considered that there is no missing plane?? Maybe the whole thing is a fabricated story, I mean it's really funny that they couldn't find the black boxes or even any wreckage. now let the idiotic comments begin.
where did all the people go? i am sure someone saw them board "A" plane.
NONSENSE... funny how 'eye witness' reports are the most unreliable in almost every case
... and I saw Elvis purchasing some Preparation H at the Wal-Mart Pharmacy this afternoon.
Did you see pink elephants too? Get off the acid lady
Did she see Elvis with a pilot's uniform on?
Not a credible account of a sighting of the missing plane.
She finished by saying, "I chose to sweep it under the carpet because I've been really busy tending to the little green men that jumped into our boat right after that."
first things first.....sometimes you need to prioritize - if the little green men were able to gain control of her boat, we may never have learned what happened....
Is she sure it couldn't have been Amelia Earhart?
I bet she also saw Superman and Santa playing checkers in that same area also.
She saw Amelia Earhart's plane too, but forgot to mention it.
Fire-explosive decompression-burning airframe, all with in the realm of possibilities as it appears there was an illicit load of Lithium batteries in the cargo hold, that are not allowed to be air transported in the USA. Possibility a satellite with IR scan mode could have gotten a thermal record of this. Needs checking out.
So why was the plane off course by 3000 miles in the opposite direction over the Indian Ocean? Did it catch on fire and burn for 8 hours before it crashed?
I taught transport pilots (airline & military) for years, plus I am an aero engineer, so know this breed of aircraft fairly well. On the "electrical" aircraft of today there are in the aircraft "systems" two Li battery packs; one forward in the lower nose area (near the cockpit) and the other aft. There are aft & forward cargo bays too. In the 370 case any one of these I would suspect for a battery fire, then hull rupture, rapid decompression, the long burning airframe pyrodegradation. In that there is potential for autopilot (flight control FC) disruptions, the plane could wonder on! If in the initial moments of the FC failure, the plane rapidly climbed, there is the possibility that the pilots had their hands full, and in this over loaded mode, did not get their oxygen masks on fast enough to prevent passing out as at altitudes above 40K, say to 44K ft there are only seconds before you pass out due to the partial pressure of Oxygen at those altitudes. All this leads to conjecture, that the now dead load of humans were in a darkened plane:headed to no where. That the plane flew on for many miles/hours is truly possible. If the pilots in their final seconds throttled back (remember they may have been in an command climb mode due to the autopilot's erroneous command to climb): the plane was then trimmed for a low power setting, as they had mind to do a controlled decent. The plane was possibly thereafter in an optimum aerodynamic configuration for long range cruise. I apologize for all the narrative, but there is a lot here to consider. Side Note: The airframe battery system, Boeing had, was from a Japanese prime battery enterprise who sub'd out, it appears the actual working. In Lithium battery technologies there is lots of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) due to the systems being so new. The LI CFD here needs to be studied as there were a number of prior related-battery incidents. NTSB as of now has also weighed in on this. Much more here to be learned.
why were the trackers turned by hand?
She's a pom, probably was smoking dope. Now she's looking for money and publicity.
Confidence in yourself? The world is looking for this plane and you're just now coming forward? I don't believe it. A government somewhere is releasing 'leaks' because they want us to believe it's in the Indian Ocean.
I am sure that I saw it too! I was playing with my periscope in the bathtub at the time, and thought that I was seeing strange lights near the toilet. I did not think anybody would believe me so I only told "slenderman" and he told me to go stab one of my friends.
It was already reported in the past that this flight carried LITHIUM BATTERIES in their cargo, and they had caught ON FIRE in the past on other flights. So this is likely what happened with this flight. Plane went down on fire, exactly what the woman saw ...
Had lithium batteries been the cause it would have been reported back to the operations center. IF even smoke had entered the cabin, you would have had dozens of people trying to use their cell phones to make calls.
Someone shot this down, is covering it up and has probably already retrieved all evidence of their mistake to hide forever.
Ask John Boehner,he will blame Obama
I am betting it has something to do with Benghazi....is there anything Clinton will not do to divert the public's attention?
First of all, I find it incredibly odd she wouldn't report this, so I'm leaning toward not believing her. But if she is right and there were two other planes nearby that, imo, means this was a govt takedown for some reason. That's just my theory. Scary thought.
Most people on the ocean would have sailed over to see if assistance could be rendered. They would have at least radioed for sighting. She a liar.
Of course she saw it - in between the pink elephants! Funny thing, it took her all this time to figure it out or sober up.
I'm told her husband spotted a herd of elephants parachuting into the sea from a huge white glowing disk several million miles above them but did not see any planes.
Wow, what compelling evidence. Obviously millions of dollars should be expended to exhaust every ounce of this drivel. Was news always so un-news worthy as this sort of junk? When news was printed, was there a better level of filtering and fact checking or did every bit of meaningless blathering make it to print?
She said what she thought she saw; deal with it. It's no less compelling than the dozen or so false positives due to Malaysia and China that cost millions. How do you fact check someone's observation? Go back in time? Mind reading? Make sure they're who they say they are? Seriously...
She also said that saw Jesus walking on water and a space ship hovering over the plane.
Perhaps a new type of Bermuda triangle has swallowed them away like so many other ships and planes.
If this is true, then where is the plane wreckage? Planes are made of material that floats, and there should have been signs of a plane that crashed in the water, if that's what happens. It is otherwise intriguing, because this would confirm the sightings from so many Maldives residents, and also the fact that those planes could be B-2 bombers from a nearby Naval base.
Elvis passed me on a motorcycle this morning.
A report without evidence is just a story.
where is the evidence the plane crashed anywhere then?
You're right, there is no evidence that it crashed. It seems like a good bet to me though.
I was on her boat too, we also ran into Amelia Earhart, Judge Crater, D.B. Cooper, and Jimmy Hoffa.
Well, this should keep the conspiracy-theory people frothing for a long time. How many theories can they come up with from this raw material?
She is full of it. She thinks she is hallucinating? Probably is! she saw nothing! It was a meteorite, a plane, a train! IT IS SUPERMAN! Good grief. Why is this a story?
I understand one thing through this article: The Daily Caller = The National Enquirer.
Because they reported what someone said...?
I wonder if she has episodes of feeling that she is going insane and low self confidence very often. If there is Xanax and/or Prozac in her medicine cabinet, I would say move along, nothing to see here.
She said she saw a plane on fire & there were two other planes flying above it and her husband didn't see anything & she thought she was hallucinating or going insane. That's what happens when someone is under the influence of some kind of drugs. She needs help.
Regarding the two planes above it, sit in a commercial jet cockpit sometime. If you're flying level, you can't see anything below you for miles in any direction. And your radar and collision avoidance systems don't care as long as you're not getting too close.
The plane wouldn't have been over the Indian Ocean until the next morning when it was light.
She sounds like a moron with a weak mind otherwise she would have said or taken some action, also what about others on the boat? Did they see the same thing or not?
I don't know whether she saw something. Certainly it is possible, but that it was 370 who could really know at this point.
While I have serious doubts about what this woman might or might not have saw, I do have to say that I surprised by the number of people discrediting the ability to see something like this at night. Trust me, when you are out on the ocean and there is no light pollution from cities, on a clear night with the moon out, you can sometimes see better than in the daytime. You would easily be able to see a bright orange fireball in the sky, and even the shapes and lights from other planes flying overhead.
Yes well what do you expect from folks who have never been from in front of thier TV or computer let alone out on the ocean at night with no city lights around to drown out the actual sky.
Was no fireball. If the plane exploded they would have found debris everywhere.
erik - the stupid english professor Bill is here too!!!!!! he chewed my ball in another article
I agree SH...Bill is a total douche!
Erik, you don't need to apologize! These jerks who have mastered the English language are jerks! I understood what you were saying!! Have a great day!
I don't think Bill is a douche at all. Many of us are completely frustrated by the dumbing down of America, and hope to help those less fortunate. :)
I think we doubt that she saw anything.
it bugs me too, when people can't spell or put a sentence together........
Really Mr. B? thier? Surprised the #$%$ Bill didn't call you on that.
"Trust me, when you are out on the ocean and there is no light pollution from cities, on a clear night with the moon out, you can sometimes see better than in the daytime" Yes, especially when you are blue water passage making short handed and are likely suffering from both sleep and sensory deprivation. :-)
BILL EVERYONE IS CALLING YOU A #$%$, I WONDER WHY?
light pollution ? now i gotta worry about that ?
Bill obviously possesses a superior command of syntax and a phenomenal grasp of grammar and apparently has endeavored to further educate himself in the semantics of his native tongue in order to communicate more gooder!
Preparing the press and the public for her upcoming book.
INTERESTING THAT SHE SAW TWO OTHER PLANES GOING THE OTHER WAY--MAYBE IT WAS SHOT DOWN?
I think she is right to question her sanity. I question her sanity.
Other people said that they saw the same thing. I know there are layers and layers of stuff concerning this event, but, suppose the airline was downed? And there is a massive coverup.
The picture is a Lockheed P-3 Orion Maritime Patrol aircraft, used by the U.S. Navy, and a bunch of other countries.
I don't think I would take this seriously. First of all, wouldn't they go see it? Second, I'm sure if they are sailing, they have a camera or cell phone with a camera. No pictures? National Inquire should interview them.
She was probably hallucinating; thank God she didn’t fall into the ocean.
This story of Katherine Tee is just another in the fine art of deception. In order to keep this saga going , the ones behind it have masterfully brainwashed the general public into believing they have no idea where in the hell it's at. They know where it's at. And when they reveal this ,it will likely get messy.
She is probably telling the truth. The plane is somewhere in the Indian Ocean, but for some weird unknown reason, no one can find it.
People will say anything these days for that moment in the spotlight.
Is this the same lady that thought Godzilla was real?
And of course they embark on this voyage with no camera,because what could they possibly see?
If she draws the conclusion after seeing a fiery plane that it was more likely she was going insane, then maybe she needs a mental evaluation. Maybe we should also evaluate her bank account while we're at it.
I saw the flight landing on Diego Garcia now painted white with no windows.
Oh btw, her book about this encounter is coming out next week, reserve your copy now.
Why are they giving this stupid attention seeking broad the time of day?
Another person wanting 15 minutes of fame.
I dont know abou her story; but the fact remains the plane is still missing. I have always felt that the lithium batteries that the plane was carrying had something to do with its fate.
Well, this support the theory that the plane was shot down by one of the Southeast nations. The search has already received criticism about it being a coverup effort. Why has the reports of debris near Bangladesh and similar sightings by fishermen not been followed? Would a shooting down of a passenger lining be a bad thing for Western allies in the region? How about the ASEAN block defense system as a whole? Hmmmm...
It was probably just a UFO taking Elvis home.
I saw President Lincoln get shot at Ford's theatre but I am coming forward now because I didn't believe my eyes at the time.
And I suppose she only reported it now because she didn't realize that half the world was looking for this plane for the past three months... I guess she doesn't watch CNN!
I often see things & think I am hallucinating...then I don't say a word about those things I am hallucinating about when it is on cnn NON STOP. I think I've seen her at home pushing a shopping cart full of luggage & talking to herself!
this story is not credible. Black smoke at 30,000 feet up? Yes, the glow would be visible, but no sign of wreckage has been found, as if the plane would stay intact while burning up at altitude?
First, I'd ask what she was smoking that evening... One has to wonder why it took her over a month before she offered or mentioned her possible visual account.
Here is my opinion and you know what they say about opinions, terrorist have found a new way to bring down commercial airlines and knowing this would destroy the airline and travel industries the world’s governments are keeping it quite.
Was Mr. Tee sleeping through the whole thing and Mrs. Tee believed it to be an everyday mundane experience and thought no point in discussing it with Mr. Tee. Sounds like they're keeping secrets.
Well British woman are born half insane. Which way they go from there depends on circumstances.
All women are born full blown whacked....LOL
Dam martinis will do it every time. I once saw Godzilla playing volleyball while I was having a Bourbon on the rocks. (make that several)
crock of #$%$. Governments know where the plane is and they will use it in the future for another terror attack. Maybe the guys Obama just let go from Gitmo! NORAD tracks EVERYTHING in the sky...but could lose a 3,000 ton flying missile with a few hundred people on it. What a joke.
The picture of the airplane in the article has four engines while the Malaysia Boeing 777-200 has two. Either the lady was dreaming or the news organization put in a wrong picture and that brings into question the reliability of its reporting.
If that were true, the world is full of idiots and cowards.
Suspiciously, she claims Amelia Earhart was piloting the craft with Jimmy Hoffa as navigator. The Lindburgh baby, DB Cooper and Elvis were waving from the windows ...
She's sailing from India to Thailand - They were just whacked out on smack and hallucinating.
Freakin whack job! Feels really bad, really, what was she waiting for to report it? My guess is that you were halluncinating from that crack pipe your smoking.
Did the lady happen to see Amelia Earhart Floating around out there in the Yellow Sea too? That's the area where she went down.
Saw the plane burning too, from Mars. Cripes!! If the article or the claim made is true, the plane would've been found the next day.
She works for Obama, what does that say for her.
I am suing Wendy's because Malaysian Airlines MH370 was in my chili.
I don't recall ever seeing something strange, and thinking that I was 'going insane'. If I did, I sure wouldn't expect many people to take me serious - as they shouldn't. This sounds more like 15 mins of fame - not anything credible at all - and taking this long? cmon. There may be one born every minute, but I'm not one of them.
It appears that nobody else knows what happened to it so it wouldnt hurt one bit to check it out. If it's a wild goose chase no big deal because they were going to waste money looking in the wrong spots anyways.
We were sailing from India to Thailand, but somehow we ended up in Asbury Park New Jersey.
One minute in the spot light,she must be bored or needs some publicity.
I suppose this should be looked into since there really aren't a lot of other clues out there, but it sounds highly unlikely that what she saw or thought she saw was the Malaysian flight.
I'm telling ya, it was aliens.
This lady must be lying. If she was telling the truth that would just devastate the conspiracy crackpots out there.
David, not at all, if the 2 planes that were sighted traveling in the opposite direction were from military.
Really? I saw BIG FOOT, the STAY PUFF MARSHMALLOW MAN and a POLITICIAN that actually did something for the people myself. Give me a Yahoo story also please...
I am sure you are lying about the Politician.
I still say they got caught in the Dragon Triangle, I know out there in the Indian Ocean theirs the dragon triangle and the Australian triangle. no one seems to want to talk about it.
This fibbing lady reminds me that any day Sarah Palin might come forward and claim she saw the plane go down from Alaska.
Once this story is reported on CNN, Obama will know what to say if questioned about it. Just in case he doesn't mention it then we know this women was definitely racist.
I want to know if we heard anything from those two other planes. And if not, why not? Their flight logs should be available.
The thing vanished, nobody knows how or why, and they never will.
Now that I think about it, I saw that airplane also, while I was playing baseball in Nashville.
A couple of FA-18's might make a big plane disappear. It may sound crazy but given the current President, I rule nothing out. A lot of things just don't add up and sadly I no longer trust my own government.
Great news everyone, CNN can now extend the Malaysian plane story another 4 months!
Was the plane surrounded by Mermaids, Unicorns , and Santa Claus? Gimme a break, another woman who wants her 15 minutes of attention!
Definitely got abducted by the UFO.
Let the conspiracy theorist loose on this one!
Damn it CNN just drop it already!
Maybe the Authorities should have searched her Boat for the Crack pipes.
This picture shows 4 engines it was a 777 that only has two, way to verify CNN.
Not to mention the plane in the picture uses propellers and not turbine engines.
That is the silhouette of a prop plane with the moon as a backlight. I didn't even bother to read this drivel, the picture is enough to tell me this article is bogus.
The pic is just a stock picture and isn't really related to the article.
D B Cooper leapt into a spacetime wormhole.....When he reappeared he was in the cockpit of MH370. He held the pilots at gunpoint until the wormhole reopened Cooper and the plane were transported to 1971. Plane and Cooper were taken to Area 51, and the incident was hushed up. USG has had 53 years to reverse engineer the planes technology. And 43 years to interrogate Cooper about his ability to create spacetime wormholes.
What a BS story. Waited till now to report it?? Despite the fact that every news agency in the world covered this story for 3 months, this woman never bothered to notice if anyone reported the plane on fire?? BS.
I think this lady is completely WACKO. No way is anything she says even remotely reasonable. You see a plane on FIRE and you feel you may be going insane. Ummm.... Where is your companion ? Did he see this plane ? Or was he doing a few laps with NEMO. Give me a BREAK. Some folks will publish anything.
Provocative but possible; shot down and not by accident.
What if the plane never hit the water but instead kept climbing, to the point it left earth's atmosphere? I know that a space shuttle has insane amounts of thrust/force/speed to get off the ground and into space, but could a plane, already traveling at 40,000 feet doing 500+mph pull the nose up and just keep going? What if that plane was so #$%$ high that it just left the gravitational pull of the earth???!?
Miriam, Short answer, NO. As the atmosphere thins out, those jet engines will shut down for lack of oxygen. I doubt a commercial airliner could operate its engine above 60,000 ft. maybe less. That's about 50 miles (260,000 ft.) short of the edge of space. As for the "gravitational pull of Earth".......the Moon is 240,000 MILES from Earth and is locked in orbit by Earth's gravity. I think maybe YOU were "so #$%$ high", that you asked these ridiculous questions....trip on sweetheart.
nothing like getting your 15 minutes of fame at someone else's expense. I don't believe her story one bit anyone with any sense would have reported it right away
She didn't say anything because she implies two other air crafts were above it and shot it down. Shes afraid of them men in black showing up at her door.
Call CNN, they need to restart the around the clock coverage right away!
She admits she is probably insane and hallucinating.
Maybe it was a bird? Or Superman?
She sure wasn't sailing from India to Thailand in a boat like the one shown and she sure wasn't standing night watch on deck in a lawn chair. Come on you guys.
If she kept THIS under the carpet, I am petrified to see what else might be lurking below.
I was in the Indian Ocean paddling my kayak all alone and I saw the missing plane being pulled into a flying saucer with a tractor beam.
Was that a John Deere or Mahindra tractor?
Partying out at sea with LSD is a felony.
Incredible story! Interesting there were other planes! Got to consider it. Why not?
It's entirely possible that she saw Air Force One that night with Obama and his posse choomin' so hard the plane was trailing smoke.
Someone does not know the difference between a motor boat and a sail boat! Did they finally figure out how to make invisible sails and masts? That s one of the dumbest renderings of a boat I have ever seen.
I saw Bigfoot once. I was parking my car for a Dodgers game and this big hairy thing ran right in front of my car and disappeared into the trees by Elysian Park. It had to be Bigfoot, or maybe it was a big, hairy, homeless guy.
I saw a Bigfoot once and he looked exactly like Richard Blaine
That must have been some really good acid.
I spotted Uranus, glowing bright orange, with a trail of black smoke behind it.
This is the best lead yet. Just a very simple observation.
Did she see the plane. Maybe, but not probably. Did she see two planes above it. No way. I live in Orlando, with heavy air traffic, and I've rarely seen three planes in the air in the approximate same location at the same time. She's somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
I think a satellite or 2 would have picked that up...
Now just a minute here! Ms Tee is on something. Her doctor prescribed it just days before her and her husband left Mozambique! I sense a book in the works.
Seems to me this woman has a few screws loose, "But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.”....if I saw something that looked like a plane on fire, I wouldn't question my sanity like that, me thinks this woman is just looking for her 15 minutes of fame. Especially since she did nothing with her information for how many months now????
Huge cover up - China downed the flight with friendly fire. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.
And she didn't call her husband to see it, and she didn't have a camera on the yacht. And she saw a trail of black smoke after midnight.
Really all the speculation and sprauling uncertainty begins to be sickening and somehow disrespectful. These people are lost and gone and I doubt we'll ever know exactly what happened... unless tech equipment accidentally stumbles on the wreck in the future. I wish the world would stop for a moment and simply offer prayers or good thoughts or whatever and be done with it.
Why not do that with all violent crime? ...Instead of having police look for murderers, kidnappers and bank robbers. Let's all just hold hands and sing and pray.
Richard: Your cynical, distorted and specious response tells us who you are (a class-A jerk) but doesn't discredit my comment. Silly silly boy.
Insults and personal attack is all you've got... ever.
She may be lying but the government is even worse.
And she dropped her camera in the water.Then she tried to use her phone to take a picture but the battery was dead.Then they ate dinner and cruised along talking about their exiting day.But wait were we hallucinating?Oh well.Are we being punked here?
Joe BIDEN sees UFO's every night. He believes his eyes. But, not to worry, he's safe from abduction because his clothes are lined in aluminum foil.
There were joint Thailand and US training operations occurring in that region at the time of went MH370 went missing. It sounds like this airliner was shot down and the governments made it look like it flew towards Australia to throw off the search teams. Could you imagine the #$%$ of "US downs civilian airliner", combined with our incredibly honest Pinocchio in office...
Laughable and sad. Someone wants attention and perhaps a book deal. Exercise some discretion, yahoo, before posting such stories or you will 50 of them before long.
I saw the face of Jesus in my corn flakes, and he was delicious.
Yes and I can tell you exactly where Amelia Earharts remains can be found.
The Never Ending story. I still think there's a good chance this thing is on land somewhere. Perhaps those five prisoners Obama just released will retrofit it, put bunches of fuel in it, a suitcase, and fly it across the Pacific. We are so secure with Obama as our leader.
So they have a dummy simulation of a female on a boat witnessing the plane going down. What took this beeeyutch so long to come out with this bu!!sheet story?
Yes, and now I'm coming forward, I saw Big Foot in my back yard yesterday. What people will do for attention! BS
This is evidence giving my suspicion that China for security reasons shot down the M.Air Bus. China demanding that air buses give their flight plan was due to acounting Air buses distination. Cia Propbably took a chance on using the air bus to spy out what their intellgence gathered by satellite. Chine saw this renegade fight so to say as a threat to their secret mission. China's aid in the search is a cover and is misleading in the attempt to hide their involvement, and US search efforts is a smokescreen much like China's on a reverse side, in otherwords CIA knows what happened, and so does China. Perhaps my immagination sounds crazy just as if one trying to convince why the Twin Towers/911 took place. But why did the PM of Malaysia accuse the CIA, and on what intelligence must have come from China's belief that the Malaysian flight was used to spy; thus China striking the air bus for security breech reasons in the loop of plausibility. My suspicion is only based on what info has been gathered of which much of it is meant to create plausibility to redirect away from the truth
Put your tin foil beanie back on the radio waves are confusing you.
Sounds like the makings of a Tom Clancy novel to me.
All BS stories from day one that dude is setting on land somewhere and not one shred of evidence proves it crashed in the water any where not so much as a seat cushion or anything found floating.
Why do people always assume the worst in other people these days. Is it because they themselves are bad..or dishonest? What good would it do this lady to say something now, what could she gain? I'll bet she gave the authorities her location at the time and hoped it would help. She did it even though she knew she'd be ridiculed, so what does that tell you...duh.
She's wrong... I saw the plane when I was swimming up the Nile in March. It flew over one of the pyramids and a great beam of light shone on it from the pyramid whereupon the plane shrank to about two inches in size and was promptly eaten by a small dog.
What she actually saw was a flying unicorn. I've seen the same thing, of course, I was drunk at the time.
AAAnd you're just saying this now? Well, there's your 15 seconds of fame sweetie. Now go back to smoking mescaline and hallucinating about Yeti's, aliens from another world and the ghost of Elvis F'g Presley.
Nutter nutter, she's crazy just looking for attention and helping the crazy conspiracy theorists out.
That ain't nothing! I saw it at McDonalds in Indiana. They were getting big macs. Does Yahoo believe me too??
Yes. They believe you were getting Big Macs in Indiana. What else is there to do?
I saw it too, along with a pink elephant riding a unicycle.
Does she normally hallucinate or just occasionally. Has she ever been insane before and if so how long did it last. Does she normally have these delusions of seeing things or is the the first time. More importantly WHAT was she smoking and where can I get some. Was it Hindu Kush or Thai Stick?
Yeah back in March I started seeing little wide bodied jets between the bristles of my tooth brush. I didn't say anything at the time but now that I have an aluminum foil cap....
She must have Superman eyes to see black smoke at night. This whole story stinks.
And why not? After all, I saw it in the Welsh sky flying tight circles and creating the whorls which made crop circles. And a friend of mine in Fharphetched Mongolia saw it stooping at Russian Migs over the Sea of Gilchrest.
Take every information serious. Take her serious please!!!
You know originally, I called #$%$. But you what, this is so stupid its probably an accurate report and this woman probably is telling the truth.
don't understand how this occurred @ night, when, if you believe the inmarsat date, the plane was flying @ 8:11 a.m.
Plane was flying at NIGHT. check the reports
I rarely think I'm going insane. I have learned that people who think they're going insane often are. Just another insane person logging on to an already insane case.
She thought it was more likely that she was going insane after initially thinking she was hallucinating. I wonder what she was on? Anyway ,this isn't exactly helpful since she didn't see it crash or anything to maybe give a clue as to where it might be.
Could she see Amelia Earhart in the cockpit?
I don't really believe in aliens and whatnot, but in this case I'll make an exception. She said the plane looked like it was on fire and there were two planes flying over it...yeah they may not have been planes and that would explain why nobody can find any trace of that plane.
Don't blame her, I saw it too. It was being piloted by Amelia Earhart with I believe Bigfoot in the right seat. Also, Elvis and the Loch Ness Monster were serving drinks in first class while Jimmy Hoffa served peanuts in coach. Please, if you had all also seen that, you would be reluctant to report it for fear of being labeled insane.
The biggest load of Bologna I have ever read. She saw a plane on fire, but didn't think about coming forward until June? It's been since March! She just wants attention
This is as at LEAST the 2nd report of a plane on fire at the time. Remember the New Zealand oilrig worker who saw the same thing?
The plane is in Diego Garcia.
Right - even though there are no hangars there. And not one of the 2000 people on the island saw it land. Um yeah, OK.
You are incorrect. There are hangars on Diego Garcia. Even if there weren't, or at least not any large enough to house a 777, that doesn't stop the plane from landing there. They had no flights scheduled for 3 days with all maintenance crew with military security clearance likely on leave. Plenty of time to whatever they wanted to that plane.
"More likely that I was going insane"! I saw a very similar sight at 2 AM on a rig in Center, Tx that lit up the sky like most meteorites will, everyone I told said "so what" but did not think about being insane. Read Fox News interview (2) with Gen. McInerny for an astonishing revelation.
Be interesting to see if there was a nations airspace where she saw that. I had a thought that the reason it took so long to release radar data was because a country shout it out of the sky to defend it's airspace. Then when they found out it was a passenger jet they just covered it up and doctored all the data to release.
Flight 370 got shot down by military jets, probably by one of the countries along it's flight path.
Publicity seeking liar. They should arrest her for filing a false police report, and keep her in jail for a few weeks, just to teach her a lesson.
The other two planes probably shot it down.
If she's lying, the addition of two other planes is certainly an interesting enhancement.
I love the comments here of the little minds belonging to little people who have done so little with their own lives. This woman is an off-shore sailor. She has guts far beyond you little snarkers, who are only watching others live fulfilling lives. Why do I get this vision that you all look and act like the "The Simpsons" comic store manager character? And as to doubting your own mind when off-shore, I was sailing in the middle of the Atlantic when all of a sudden this amazing brightly, creamsicle-orange lit "Conastoga-type "Prarie Schooner" Wagon popped up on the horizon in front of me. It grew bigger and bigger for minutes! I was freaking out! lolol Finally, it revealed itself for what it was. In the darkness, I couldn't see that there was a low hanging cloud resting just a finger's width above the horizon. As a full moon started to rise in a beautiful, pastel orange hue, the top of the moon was blocked by the slightly down curving cloud, making it look like the sloping curve of a covered-wagon's drooping canvas. When I finally figured out what was really happening, I started laughing so hard that I was glad I was "harnessed in".....so close was I to falling overboard. :) Things can get weird out there, my untested, boring snarkers. Get a life...do something with it...and you will start, hopefully, to understand some people live on much bigger planets than the one you have built for your limited lives.
says the guy on his computer to the others on thiers.. hypocritical #$%$-hole
Commenter, The last line of your post says it all. Well done.
Not special, Texan. I just DO stuff with my life. So many waste it. If you want to label that special, go ahead. SInce my friends also have active lives, we don't think of ourselves as anything but normal. If you are a spectator in life, please....continue. And SAM...thanks, my friend. I doubt the rest here have never heard of, let alone actually read, Teddy Roosevelt's "The Critic", or the great little book "Johnothan Livingston Seagull." I just get a burr under my saddle with all these cynics of life. Did our gutsy sailor see something? I don't know. The point of my comment that she may have seen something that wasn't really there. And if there is a likely time for an illusion to happen, it is definitely offshore. :)
And it only took two months to come forward with this information.
"she looked up the flight plan of the aircraft and discovered their journeys intersected", the only problem is that the flight plan of the missing plane was never to fly over the Indian ocean! What a joke. No one has any idea of the actual path the plane took!
1 the article has a 3d rendering of a motor boat not a sail boat, 2nd she is a moron, I saw 3 jets 2 jets shoot lights at the other bigger jet, then smoke and then it crashes, I thought man I need to stop smoking crack cuz I thought I was imagining it, when we get back to land I see they are searching for a plane, and I didn't think while I was on crack that this might be the plane they are looking for, oh but wait if I tell anyone I was smoking crack they may not believe me what a moron.
Cynical little flucker aren't you. She might be a moron, but you're a prickk
Perhaps you should try some blue water passage making on a short handed vessel before you start talking about crack shawn. get out of mommy's basement.
Umm did you read the article? No one shot lights at anyone she said they had normal running lights and she never saw the jet crash either. So 3rd You are the actual moron.
those weren't planes above it, those were alien space ships, they disabled the communications and shot it down with their ray guns...
The alternative theory that the plane was disappeared due to tech on board from Afghanistan may have some truth? Who was out with planes from reasonable searchable bases at the time?
She is not much of an ocean sailor is she sees a plane on fire with two other planes flying away and does not believe what she thought she saw. I agree that she must have been smoking some really good s**t that night and it takes her until now to say something. Maybe she and her husband wanted to smoke it all up before allowing anyone near their boat. I certainly would not have told this story.
She comes forward three months after it went missing? Did she also say she saw Elvis piloting it?
Hmm, last I checked, you generally cannot see below from a plane, even in the junkpit.
True story.....I was driving by Area 51 last night and I saw Elvis hitchhiking right outside the gate. I stopped and asked him if he needed a lift, but he wasn't going my way. He was headed to Vegas to party with Tu-Pac. Anyway, he did tell me that to keep a look out for a Malaysia passenger plane about to to take off because it was repainted to look like a Sea World whale. He said the passengers won't be onboard because the scientists there are still probing their brains with new Google instruments. So if anyone is looking for the plane, keep an lookout for a whale in the sky.
You must be from Washington or Colorado... because you're clearly high on something. ;-)
Think it's funny? People lost family and you're making jokes. The only joke here is your pathetic life.
My grandpa, a veterinarian, was tending some animals in the hills of Los Angeles back in the 40's. He saw a flying saucer come down, but before he could get to the spot, the military had sealed it off.
He's merely trying to help us appreciate how ABSURD her story is. Personally, I'm trying to figure out what took her so long to mention it.
Yeah sure #$%$ I was just on the phone with Bigfoot and he said you're nuts.
Lighten up W .... loss of life is a tragedy. Learn to take a joke and maybe consider renting a sense of humor.
you ignorant #$%$ "con" serva "tick"
@B A... Try renting a personality that isn't FUBAR.. Humor is fine. Didn't ask you anyway.
my theory - UFO abducted her and implanted these false memories so outlandish no one would believe them.
Obviously she hasn't the slightest idea what she saw! It could've been this, it could've been that... Another dead end...
Makes you wonder if the Chinese shot it down for violation their supposed air space.
I feel sorry for the families that lost loved ones! A 777 aircraft is one of the most sophisticated flying today. It's bull #$%$ NO ONE knows where this plane is or went down!! I always believed this was a huge cover up!!
This and other stories have been sent in from people who were on the northern arc. I can see why she would be worried. She's not an expert and was humble enough to know that she could have just been seeing things. At this point however, these leads are probably more credible now that the southern arc has been showing up nothing
She said that had seen, but her husband what he saw? Why he is not making comment in this report? Does he disagree with her in what they seen? The Daily Caller need to come up with better story not sensationalism journalism. Two witness and one only talking. At least that he was sleeping while she watch the skies.
I thought I saw a hunchback once but it was just an illegal with a mule pack of marijuana on his back!
Sounds like a load of #$%$ to me. Why, when she ultimately did hear about the Malaysian plane, didn't she say something to someone at that time? Especially given the fact that several countries were attempting to locate it?. And, she claims she saw two other planes flying above it? Wouldn't Malaysian air traffic control (or whoever is responsible for that area) be able to verify that there were other planes in that area or flying over that body of water on the date she claims she saw it?
Because so many times the authorities ignore tips and/or leads, which turn out to be credible.
Got to agree with you on that and her claim doesn't help the families. Rather it is like pouring salt water on a wound.
Carlos the #$%$, i agree with Michael, sounds like a load of #$%$! Kind of like your grammar.
I agree, if she didn't think anything of it at that time, then why not say something later when you heard of the plane crash. I'm pretty sure she would've heard of it when she reached land. This is why I'm a bit skeptical of her account.
@Carlos - People like you make me sick!! Why don't YOU re-read the story for the explanation she gave for not saying anything.
Carlos- your a d! (k. Dont get so angry.
My mother witnessed the explosion of the space shuttle over Texas and went to the nearest phone to report it. She thought it was just a plane until the news coverage revealed what it was. Guess what, Tee, she had never seen anything like it either but she did the right thing. So here it is June, and you just decided to report what your eyes couldn't believe in May even though the TV was barraged with coverage? I believe one part of your story. The part where you said maybe you were just losing your mind. Are you sure you're not seeking some public attention?
I saw the Columbia break up over Texas too. I lived in North Texas at time, and remember standing outside watching the streaks flying and just crying.
Strange...was your Mother observing the Shuttle launch with high-power binoculars or a telescope?!
"...what your eyes couldn't believe in March..." I think you meant.
Harry, not the launch, the break up of Columbia over Texas.
You do realize, she was on a SAILBOAT crossing the OCEAN. I doubt she was watching TV.
Correction: OUR televisions were barraged with coverage because it was easier than talking about things that actually matter here. Seeing that she's from another country, it's not too weird to think they might not be as barraged as we were.
I agree, she stood there looking at it, and it never occurred to her to try taking a picture with a cell phone or camera that authorities could possibly review later?
Correct, edgarayce. I meant March. Jesse - by her own admission according to the article, she kept it quiet, meaning she had opportunity to report. Harry - step away from the torpedo. Many witnesses saw the Columbia breaking apart over the Texas skies. Everything doesn't happen in outer space. How do you think all those space shuttle parts made it to the ground? People witnessed what happened when the shuttle came back into the atmosphere and it was a sad day for those astronauts. You shouldn't make light of it.
big fish. what is wrong with you? have you ever sailed? have you seen meteor showers? did you think you could just call 911. uh duh. your mom was on land with a phone. go pick on someone else. bully. and the mental ilness? take a look in the mirror. you get on a public forum and start attacking a total stranger. who is sick?
@Cynthia - ever occur to you not everyone has a phone shoved up their a z z 24/7?
Just like seeing the aliens in Roswell.
Cut back on the LSD Katherine.
LOL I saw big foot last month. This crazy old dude has a blog, said he saw one on Dec. 20th in the norther woods of Minnesota. I wasin the northern woods of minnesota at that time and I swear I saw it too! (obviously fabricated, much like this lady's story)
I don't blame her for not saying anything. In today's media, you never know what they will turn you into. Everything has to have proof, and no one's word is taken for face value anymore. Before you know it you are a re lunatic and insane and racist and so on... One can go up from being a witness to being a criminal, with his/her entire life being destroyed. Ask Mark Fihrman if you don't believe me...
Ahh, no. Sorry, but this can't be real. Just another wild goose chase meant to keep the government of Malaysia searching....with no intentions of finding it. Search until everyone, but the survivors, gets tired of this story and forgets. What's the suffering of a few hundred families, when it comes to keeping a government from explaining and taking responsibility for what could potentially be an act of war.
She saw a meteor...first time you get a look at one of those at night when it passes close enough to where you can see the flames, you don't think meteor. I saw one at night when I was on a vehicle stop with someone. We both saw it, and were both blown away...we thought it was a satellite coming down.
I believe she didn't have enough sex the night before, that is why she hallucinated.
Wow! Now here, s a person I can actually admire. She can admit she was wrong, made a mistake and pehaps later yes, tries her best to rectify it. Very good Katherine tee.
HAHAHA!!! wow.......................................you're as delusional as she is!
No matter how far fetched this might sound, suggest we get this woman's deposition, including the coordinates where she was when the event occurred, and let's go see....all the men and all the technology haven't been able to find the plane, so have at it!
Oh well, Obama is prepared to hand over twenty high level Taliban's from prison for the return of this plane. Any excuse to re-establish and release our enemy.
she was hallucinating considering the Malaysian government "knows" it crashed off the coast of Australia (even though they can't find it).
Why is everyone so quick off the mark to discount her story? It seems plausible to me.
It might be. But 3 months?
I think I saw my missing $2500 in annual healthcare savings I was clearly promised, but can't be sure. Someone made Liar of the Year in 2013 and goes by the name of Barry.
Hey, Daily Caller / Yahoo, last March while sitting in my backyard I saw an aircraft that looked like MH370 and it was being followed by four Kardashians on flying carpets, three UFO's flown by purple aliens, Santa's sleigh & reindeer being flown by Elvis & Michael Jackson, and a partridge in a pear tree. Can you come out and write an article about me?
I saw the same thing, but Bigfoot was clearly in the cockpit.
M, you're making that up! Everyone knows Bigfoot isn't rated to fly that type of aircraft, he's only good for single-engine. It was Bat Boy (of Weekly World News fame) with an assist from the inflatable auto-pilot...
Yeah right, and I saw Obama's real birth certificate.
Your mom has it, she owes me for last night.
The one he released is a proven fake.
As a Christian, I personally find her story credible.
Just another insecure woman...E-gads, then what is she doing out in the middle of the ocean sailing?? Something seems diametrically opposed to reasonable thought here!
I am discounting her story because the lack of any debris. A plane on fire or shot down would leave a large debris field.
if they were looking in the area when the debris was floating.. remember it was several weeks before they determined the plane had changed course
There would still be a debris field. Also she stated she saw other lights from a plane. If the plane was shot down by a military fighter they would not be using their lights on the plane. She's trying to grab the spot light.
Of course she and her husband are mariners; they recorded their exact location when they saw something that appeared to be an airplane on fire. It would be nice for the searchers to have that information. The searchers could then compare Katherine's alleged sighting(s) with the search area where the searchers have looked.
She mentioned hallucinating, crazy and not believing her eyes. What she may have seen were the tracers the pole on her boat were giving off while on acid..Why would you not think it odd a plane was smoking and plummeting to the water as out of the ordinary..
I was under the impression that the seas out there were so terrible it was almost impossible to search. But yet you can sail thru there ? What part of this does not smell like sensationalism ?
Yeah, the media really piled it on!
Her entire story smacks of delusion...Her boat was not equipped to go very far offshore...She waited a very long time to disclose her info..The other planes she mentions would probably have noticed something irregular...Who Knows/? its a very crazy world out there.. I happen to be a veteran sailor with over 29 years at sea...rich people with their yatchets are a constant source of amusement for navy and merchant sailors.......we often need to rescue their sorry butts because they often fail to observe the rules of seamanship... enuff said!
Most likely this delusion was rooted in a dream she had. She was probably was watching a lot of coverage and had a dream about it, failing to realize it was something she dreamt and not actually witnessed
she was probably scared to report it, because in her eyes, the situation doesnt make sense... from what she described, maybe she thought two planes were shooting down the airplane (and she didnt want to be the witness to that)...
if she saw what she thinks she saw it should not be hard to at least verify the area or whether two other aircraft were in the area about the same time...it either happened or it did not...a little sleuthing might verify.
A story that runs contradictory to evidence, and which is impossible to corroborate. Unfortunately, the conspiracy theorists will cling to this like it's gospel.
The plane blindly followed another plane right behind it and then landed in Pakistan.
"What we have here is a failure to communicate"-Cool Hand Luke. Very unlikely that this person saw what she thought she claimed she saw..too much wine or herbs is a possible explanation. Normally, this person would have reported it long ago. Unlikely story. Perhaps, a couple wanting to create some news.
this will turn out to be the biggest international coverup of the 21st century.. Malaysia had no choice but to shoot down the plane when negotiations failed.
Sounds like a lady who knows she can get some media attention by reigniting interest in a story that is waning.
I saw the plane that night over Little Rock, Arkansas! Can I get a news story, too???
It's certainly a more credible explanation than the world's government's have provided and people seem to trust them.
Why is the Daily Caller even considered a news source?
I read the ingredients on a cereal box, doesn't make it newsworthy.
She probably was hallucinating, and just came of her acid trip.
I have a feeling she is republican.
The story does "SEEM" suspicious, but there is no evidence presented here which would indicate that it is true or false. Some posters on this site will try to lead you to believe otherwise. Sort of like liberals trying to get you to think their way. They are right and you are wrong, regardless of "the sky is really red" story that they are getting ready to tell you. Just understand that from the start.
You are a complete LOON, Katherine Tee!
Elvis Presley and Jim Morrison just drove past me in an old white Mercedes-Benz.
I saw James Brown with John Lennon at the McDonald's drive-thru in John's polka dotted Rolls-Royce.
It's really sad that the plan didn't crack under pressure underneath the water because of depth. However, the water must not be that deep because they would have found pieces floating but that didn't happen. That is a sad way to die underneath water and no air in a enclosed space. I would have think a window would have crack open or someone would have tried to crack a window. Pray for the families and God bless them!...
Not a very timely release of information. After all this exposure in the news and lapse in time she had probably dreamed it while sunstroke, seasick or hangover.
Thought she hallucinated? Is she on a lot of drugs?
Probably ate an entire pot candy bar.
More like a UFO picked her up & brainwashed her, or maybe the Queen had a heart to heart with her concerning this matter!
even if she did actually see THIS ... does she have an accurate navigational fix on her position at the time of the sighting? otherwise its of no use to anyone.
We heard for quite awhile that the Indian Ocean has rough seas, that the weather is bad, etc. SO she and her husband were just sailing across the Indian Ocean, eh? Sounds like horse poo.
4 MEN on the plane had about 4 billion EACH in patent ownerships used by their parent company. One article said with their combined deaths the "owners" of the company would over time share an additional 40 billion in profits. -- 40 BILLION $$$ is a lot of motive to commit mass disappearance.
What ever. Guess someone is looking for attention.
Planes don't just disappear. It makes more sense now that the carlile group shot it down . . .
I saw it and I am in California. If she really saw it, why wasn't this story picked up a long time ago.
Hogwash. Just another loony bird looking for 15 minutes on the news.
We now know that the satellite data is useless ... Why? No plane was found where satellite data tells us to look at... Time to investigate other leads..
GET YOUR LIPS OFF OF THE CRACK PIPE LADY! YOUR STILL HALLUCINATING! HAHAHA 2 MONTHS LATER SHE SAYS SOMETHING! REALLY!
Gee that's funny, because I was parasailing on the surface of Mars the other day, and I swear I saw it go right over my head!
Given the lying and deception and cover up by the Malaysian government, it suggests that they shot down the plane and did not want to admit it.
Ask a liberal where the missing jet is. They are the 'smart' ones. Remember??
Just another crazy senile female. I see them everyday young and old.
This shouldn't be dismissed. Few people know how to react when faced with an extraordinary situation.
If that's truly the case, she defines mentally slow.
IDIOT! That story was the biggest news for over a month and that clueless Brit decided to wait months before she said anything? Goes to show Brits are idiots whether they're worshipping their freeloading so-called "Royal Family" to saying "look, there's a burning airliner...let's not say anything while the entire world talks about where the hell it is".
If I tell you a story, how much will I get paid for it. It might take me a while to put it together. or Let's wait till this will be more sensational, we'll get paid for more interviews. Funny when I read this in my head I heard it being read by Marilyn.
Stupid airheaded dumb lady. And to think these morons have the money to be sailing around the world while the rest of us chumps have to work.
Not everyone has a PR person or a teleprompter telling them what to say. She sounds more believable than those who claim to know everything but know nothing.
I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.”. this is not a rational person , this is a dumb sheep of a person. most likely republican conservative. and I'm sure rich. a person who thinks they are most likely going insane as a reasonable choice shouldn't be living smh
What kind of person first assumes she is hallucinating rather than seeing a real life event?
Did she and her husband get abducted by aliens while sailing across the Yellow Sea also?
She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time .and I don't believe her eyes now, there is 100 plane in sky ever time I look, it is cover up , if plane was crashed Boeing fund it and clean crash site, or was hijack by pilots to n Korea or Pakistan.
I personally doubt if flight MH370 will ever be found which is sad for the familes who had loved ones on that flight. Their grief must be as strong today as I was the day the flight was reported missing. They want closure and to be able to say Goodbye properly.
I saw Elvis eating a burrito at the bus station.
She's full of shart. Some people will do anything to get in the National enquirer.
"I saw three jets 2 shoot lights at the other bigger jet, then smoke and then it crashes"? I have reread the story and cannot find a statement anywhere close to this, i.e., no mention of planes shooting at another plane and the bigger jet crashing. Who is smoking crack?
I do not believe her, she is looking for media hype is all, you do not wait months to say something, how lame does she think the public is. Please let it be so, and they find the plane now, they will have a navigational map of their cruse, so they can pinpoint it on their map and go from there. Bet they cannot produce that, because this woman did not see a thing. And why would not 2 other planes report the fire, if they were above it, they woul have seen it on their radar. I think she is not telling the truth
Unless the other planes were on it, as they shot it down?
Iggy really have you meet this person? So unless do you have proof that she is she is looking for media hype ?
I believe her. She probably did see the plane in question. It doesn't seem odd to me at all that she might have also seen 2 additional planes... those would be the planes that shot it down by order of some nameless, faceless man that made money from all this or will now make money after all this. Either way- someone knows what happened and lots of folks are making money because of it... that's the way our world works = dirty deals between a handful of men that run the planet. And just as a side note: at this point, would you come forward if you really thought you knew where that plane was? You might not if you wanted to continue breathing. Someone powerful REALLY wants this to remain a mystery and they're clearly able to do whatever's necessary to keep it that way despite public outcry from multiple countries. If this woman was in fact sailing around the Indian ocean with her husband, they must have a pretty comfortable life... would you really want to risk loosing your comfortable existence (on the behalf of dead strangers) if you could choose to simply stay quiet instead? Put down your kool-aid and think it through.
More importantly, how did you get away with typing #$%$ with out being censored??????????
No i am questiong why so many people thinks is is lying.. Does anyone have proof she is.
Did you mean cruise..or cruz..or...never mind.
I'll comment when I can believe my eyes.
wait, it let me do it, trip on that!
the other two planes shot it down and came back at daylight and sank any thing that floated,,..///
Actually, it took his comment away completely. Very strange...........
I would kill myself if i find another worthless article like this on Yahoo!
that means you are now dead . I'm sorry .
Obama is praying that this will make it back into the news and take the eyes of America off of his constant mistakes!
It sounds like the Diego Garcia theory is not so far fetched anymore.
In related news: She and her husband saw Elvis dockside.
When I was snorting mounds of coke and taking tab after tab of LSD out on the Indian Ocean I saw Jesus and Godzilla and they were on fire.
Don't understand the vitriol on this message board. Dumb vitriol at that.
A more simple explanation is "sea sickness" and the greed for her 15 minutes of fame.. Even if they find the wreckage the passengers are all fish food by now. peace to their souls..
So far in my opinion this is the only storyline that has sounded credible so far. I said from the beginning...this plane was shot down entering restricted air space.
If true, perhaps these other planes were checking out the flight after another country shot them down. Don't forget, Thailand now has a military coup. What else has Thailand been up to? Perhaps the Thailand military shot the flight down.
Until many years pass or wreckage is found and the black boxes decoded. I still have a feeling the plain was hijacked, landed safely and is being modified to be a big bomb and to be flown someday. Don't ask me what I think happen to the passengers, you won't like what I think happen.
Don't be surprised to hear about another large airplane disappearing in the same way.
my thoughts exactly,oh the payload it could carry if all the seats were removed.hey they did fly large aircraft at us before.imagine if those passengers were explosive!
5 Talibans traded for hijacked plane?
No Breadcrumbs... wake up. flight 370 happened back in March.
That makes sense. The plane turned around and most likely was out of the normal air corridor . The Malaysia military thought it was a intruding enemy plane and shot it down with a missile. Thus, the Malaysia military took time to cover up their track for a few days while the search parties was searching the wrong area in the South China Sea. Only days later, the Malaysian military said they saw the plane on radar.
Yeah....that's the ticket.....yeah, yeah, shot down.
Reminds me of the movie Airplane! when they had engine noise from a prop plane every time they showed the exterior of the jet. Maybe she heard jet noise. Need a vector, Victor? Get me a clearance, Clarence. And Joey probably still likes movies about gladiators.
Have you ever seen a grown man naked ?
My dad said that you only really work during the playoffs.
Where's Otto when you need him ?
I told you not to call me Shirley!
This was a bad day to stop sniffing glue.
They could be miles off course! That's not possible they have instruments.
And it looks like a giant Tylenol!
I hate when people misquote movies...
Pamela, there's a story behind that. Zucker, Zucker, and Abrahams wanted to use a prop plane model for those exterior shots. But, the studio nixed it for some reason. So, they instead substituted the prop plane sound. Airplane! is actually a spoof of a movie called "Zero Hour", released in 1957. The 3 guys had set a VCR to record late night television for material to use in Kentucky Fried Movie, and happened to record Zero Hour. It ultimately inspired Airplane!
I need to see airplane again because I was too young to get all the humor...great movie
You ever been in a #$%$....pit before?
This may be a baby boomer party i just walked into
Ever been in a Turkish prison?
Surely you can't be serious. I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.
These people need to go to a hospital. "What is it?" It's a big place where sick people go.
Do you enjoy watching movies about gladiators.
Cream? No thanks. I take my coffee black-- like my men.
That's what led to my drinking problem...
(Glug glug liquor) Care for some, sister? Certainly NOT! (cocaine sniff!)
ACCORDING to her account. it seem like some one ordered to shoot it down.
So Billy, do you ever watch gladiator movies?
Yes, I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.
Misleadia@ Thanks for the info about the airplane engines. It turned out to be perfect. I do know about Zero Hour and the non-comedy lines are verbatim from that movie. United Airlines uses the the Zero Hour scene of Robert Stack and the slapping in the cockpit to introduce it's new hire pilots to crew resource management.
Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue...
I'll take Hamm on three and hold the Mayo.
...There's no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you'll enjoy the rest of your flight. By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?
Good for at least a full week of CNN coverage. Pumping new life into what was a great network under Ted Turner's ownership but now is an agenda driven leftist propaganda machine.
It wouldn't be "fair and balanced" if FOX News were the only agenda driven propaganda machine.
I kind of believe it was shot down also and covered up. Just like the United Airlines Flight 93 on 9/11 that was supposedly taken over by the passengers. Our own government shot that plane down because they knew it was heading for the White House. Good cover up story though. Turn the victims of the plane into heroes
Where are the pieces, some things never sink, and the fuel slick ?
Just where is that White House ? Vietnam ?
This whole thing is a cover up! We are being lied to! The truth will soon be leaked, that the plane WAS found, and it was INTACT! The fuel tank half full. No structural damage at all, anywhere, no broken windows, no water inside the plane, everything was normal, EXCEPT there were NO people, and seatbelts were still buckled. And. There was a written note, hastily scrawled which said. "They ARE for real!"
Initial satellite images showed large, smoldering objects floating on the water near the point where radar contact was lost. Never explained...
I never think i am hallucinating because i have never hallucinated. Sounds like an LSD situation.
Shot down by armed oil industry-owned aircraft sent out to snuff out the 20 electric car experts who were on board.
The Jet flew to Africa and it's being fitted with bombs. Wait and see ! A plane in trouble doesn't make a U turn at the exact point where it goes off radar. You think they have radar on the West Coast of Africa ? They got plenty of Muslim fanatics.
I really wonder if this plane was accidentally shot down during war games, and the countries are just trying to cover it up. With today's technology they should have found the plane by now.
perhaps it was intentionally shot down and not by accident during war games...i have read that there were at least 20 Chinese scientists onboard that helped to develop America's "invisible soldier" technology...upon completion of the project the Chinese quit working for the US government and headed back home to China, they were on flight 370 and havent been seen since... ancient chineese secrets...huh ? no, just dirty American secrets !
looks like I was correct in stating to look at the last known position, and the failure was catastrophic...explosion in an engine
Sounds like that plane was shot down for intruding on other countries air space.
Too many discrepancies in her story. Number 1: How can you see black smoke at night. Number 2: How can you tell the other planes were ABOVE the "burning" plane at night. Can it be smaller planes with smaller navigation lights? Number 3: Did her husband saw the same thing? and number 4: Why tell only now? You are not hallucinating if you find out that everyone is looking for a missing plane a day after you have a sighting unless of course it's a hoax.
If its a full moon or close to it than it's very possible to see black smoke.
Or the orange fire could have illuminated the smoke.
1. Many people interpret what they see, and not state what they saw. 2. If they were sailing, they may have had limited communication abilities and they may have been at sea for many days. 3. If there were moonlight, you certainly could see black smoke.
You might be the worst Detective ever. Everyone of your stupid questions have obvious answers.
Why tell now? Because she wants to be part of the movie they will make about this in a few years
it could be grey smoke too no? When I see fires there are all different shades of smoke and the fact that there was fire and possibly moonlight it leaves it open for debate.
(1) Yes you can (2) The burning plane was flying at low altitude while the 'other' planes can be distinguished at higher altitudes with their blinking lights (3) he was obviously below deck (4) she explained that in the article
I live in Los Angeles with a lot of airline traffic and I can't tell squat if one plane is flying higher than the others especially at night.
1) smoke can be illuminated by the fire or the moon. 2) Don't you know "above" and "below"? She does too. 3) Well, ask him. 4) Some people don't like publicity.
i'll try to dumb this down for ya: lower flying planes appear larger the opposite is true for higher flying planes... but of course it gets complicated if a low flying plane is a small plane to begin with...sorry, I didn't mean to make your head explode.
I am an ex-Coast Guardsman turned competitive sailor that has logged 10's of thousands of miles on the open ocean. In my experience, it is quite easy to see black smoke at night, especially when there are no clouds in the sky and even more so if there is a moon. It is quite breathtaking how bright the stars and planets light up the sky when you are 100's or 1,000's of miles from shore. It is not dark like most would imagine. Your night vision certainly assists in this as well. It is when there is no moon and cloud cover when it is at its darkest. Which brings up an interesting point...what was the weather like when she saw the plane? Was it clear, cloudy, moon, no moon? That will greatly assist in eliminating an discrepancies in her story. As far as her husband goes, if it was just the two of them transiting the ocean, he was more than likely down below, off watch, sleeping...as it appears by her story, she was on watch and driving. And based on their location, they wouldn't of hit land for days, if not weeks. You don't get the same pleasantries the rest of us do thousands of miles from shore...there are no news channels to update you on current events. You catch up on life outside your own when you hit shore. That's the beauty of ocean sailing...it's you, your boat, your life and your destination. That's it. Nothing else in the world matters.
You know damn well they have a radio on board as well....Don't buy this for second.
It wasn't a full moon that night. Only a first-quarter moon.
Hey Angel I live in LA too. I can tell when an airplane is higher than another both during the day and night.
Brent, that's correct. But no matter how bright the moon was, its very unlikely she would see black smoke. Gray maybe, but not black.
Angel, you can tell by how loud the plane is. If you can hear it, then its either taking off or nearing approach.
Not everyone wants to be famous, notorious, read-about, included in a movie, etc. If her quotes reflect her nature, the woman does not seem to be craving attention. I'd take this woman's story seriously. Though her eye-witness account might help in figuring out why the plane went down, it probably won't help in locating the plane.
I agree with you!! She was right...that she was hallucinating!
I disagree.....I find her story quite believable. It could have been dusk or early morning...the moon could have provided light.....when you are disconnected in the ocean sailing like that...you don't what the news is...and I find it believable she was feeling like she could not believe her eyes......she probably does not know where she was though at the time....
That's racist to say you can't see black smoke at night
I also wondered about her husband's observations. If I saw what I thought was a burning plane, I would have surely called my spouse's attention to it. Even if he was sleeping.
Why did the other planes not report this?
SnGF is correct. It was a 1/4 moon that night, not a full. She was hallucinating.
"Too many discrepancies in her story." Um, ya think? How about most of all waiting THREE MONTHS to come forward with her story??
If only the people who wrote these articles analyzed like you.
No her husband didn't see it. he was in the galley mixing some more Gin and Tonics and looking for his cell phone to call Anderson Cooper at CNN to try and get some TV time.
This woman needs to take an Ambien and go lay down. She is either #$%$ or crazy.
ambien might have been the problem since she might have been hallucinating.
If she thinks that that plane in the photo looks like a Boeing 777, then she needs her eyes tested! That's looks like a Lockheed Electra/Navy P-3 Orion.
There was no suggestion the photo is what she saw.
Then why is the photo there? Who's the mongrel moron now, barking pup?
Why did she wait so long to reveal this? She finally comes forward more than 2 months after it disappeared?
Yup, got shot down by USAF to keep Obozo's dad from spilling the beans about his son.
you probably should worry more about your dad
Obama tried to kill him also!
Crazy #$%$ is looking for attention.
obese stacy, #$%$ women should not be posting on the internet, lose some weight first
lockjaw, live up to your name please. Give the every lie detection test we have and interrogate her. If she's lying, sink her boat.
"There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time" very interesting huh, wonder if anyone on board had government ties.
Do you REALLY believe this broad Miguel. Because if you do, I've got some land about 50 straight west of downtown Miami to sell you.
I was fishing in the California delta the other day and swear I saw that plane sticking out of the water. COME ON FOLKS, CATCH A CLUE. YOU WON'T FIND THE PLANE. IT DID NOT CRASH. IT WAS LANDED SOMEHWERE IN MIDDLE EAST AND ALL PEOPLE ON BOARD ARE BEING HELD CAPTIVE. STAY TUNED, THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME. NOW LETS GET HILLARY AND THE REST OF THESE LIBS AND REPUBS OUT OF OFFICE AND LETS GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE BENGHAZI TRUTH, OK?
Please travel to Australia and speak your findings to the experts that are searching for the plane. I am sure you know far more than the sonar equipment and the many experts from various countries that are working on this. Since you seem to know more than anyone else, don't you think you OWE it to the FAMILIES to come forward with your PROOF?
Eric youse name rhymes wid PRlCK, DlCK and SCHTlCK. But I agree with you....
She is clearly delusional, so if she were American, she would vote Republican.
If she is delusional, then she obviously voted Obama twice like the rest of you sheeple did. However, that delusional fog is lifting and the smart Americans have come to their senses. A fact that will be proven in November when the liberals get it handed to them big time.
Yahoo couldn't take 10 seconds and GOOGLE a photo of the same type of aircraft that was missing to use in the photo.....now THAT'S amazing.
The article came from The Daily Caller.
@patrick evidently YOU couldn't take 2 seconds to read that it came from another news source.
besides wouldn't Yahoo, "Yahoo" a photo of the same aircraft.
Jesus who cares what stock photo they used.
The video belongs to Reuters (not Yahoo or Daily Caller).
So the news doesn't matter, you just have to criticize right?
This could be true, Two friends and i saw what looked like a very big disk entering the atmosphere one night above the national forest long trail. We could see the outline of it as it came in. The fire/heat from the friction of entry made an outline of the leading edge, a huge disk at a moderate angle 35 40 degrees and pitched to one side. One of them wouldn't even acknowledge it the other said it was nothing and I say it was indeed a disk shaped object from what i could see this thing must have been as big around as a football field is long, maybe bigger. We were in Goshen Vermont just below the long trail entrance on Brandon gap. People do see things so overwhelming that the brain just will not acknowledge it. NASA is looking for life out in space, i think the life they are looking for is here already. The Ananocky have returned. Thats why there is no gold to be found in Fort Knox. All the repositories are empty, governments are going insane the monetary system is broke.
Wayne? I think you might have jumped the tracks brother. Good luck.
You must be smoking some good stuff.
Well, don't bogart it! Pass it around, God knows we need a good buzz to take the edge off from what is going on.
an the friggin wurld is clapsin in on us........
This is amusing, off topic but still ...
Yes, Wayne. All of those disc-shaped sightings over the past 70 years and not one has hit the ground or been found. Or, wait, maybe NASA has found them all first, before any eyewitness outside of government paid agencies could find them. What a coincidence! And the galaxy discovering Hubble hasn't spotted one form of unearthly life to date. No, wait, it has and the government is keeping it a secret because only the US government would know such information. No other government or science lab in the world could possibly know what is really out there. Its only the US government, and they're not telling a soul because they are the world's best at keeping secrets, unless of course, it's the name of a CIA operative or some kind of national security information.
Wow, Wayne, you and this lady must both be insane!
Just how high were you, Wayne? And I don't mean in elevation.
Wayne is the smart one here
Just getting back from that extended trip to Colorado huh Wayne ???
Posts like this are the reason why I read articles from Yahoo. Thank you sir.
This is why you have to watch what you choose to post. Everyone loves to jump on the bandwagon.
@Wayne: Sorry to inform you, but OUR money is NOT backed by gold, silver, or lead held at Fort Knox, it is backed by NOTHING, but a promise that it's worth something more than the paper it's printed on!
Wayne, shouldn't you be on a ledge somewhere?
Notice that Wayne didn't say one thing about Hilary's unborn child...I think that tells us something.
Have you ever thought about writing fiction?
LOL@Uall, just because you can't imagine that somebody saw something unusual in the sky doesn't mean it didn't happen. I simply stated the facts as i know them to be. So can one of you brilliant people tell me what exactly do the astronauts do on the space station? Just what is going on up there that needs us to return so often or stay over so long? lol you believed Obama when he ran for president but you can't believe myself and two others saw a disk shaped object coming into the earths atmosphere...lol... the world is in trouble isn't it.
I think I saw a disk shaped object coming back down to earth too and it's called your brain.
Sure thing republican nuts will try and blame Obama administration as a conspiracy. Fruitcakes.
So she could see the black smoke trailing behind it in the middle of the night over an ocean with no other light source?
Probably flames interspersed with the smoke causing it to glow.
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” ...I think she answered your question herself.
Well, if the night was clear the stars / moon could be a tremendous light source in the middle of nowhere. If not, you're right, no way.
You can still see smoke on an unlit night. Have you ever walked in the dark away from the city out in the woods or been on a lake in the middle of the night? You can see quite clearly if there are no clouds blinding the night from the starts and moon. We always navigated Lake Rayburn & Toledo without lights @ 4-5 a.m.
Water reflexes light better than land, so the moon would actually give you more light on the open ocean than on land. Unless there was not a moon it would be very easy to see a plane on fire with black smoke behind it.
If you ever get out of your city, you may discover that on a clear moon-lit or star-lit night, after your eyes have 'adjusted' you can 'almost' read a book.. Don't snort - try it ! We used to do night patrols in the swamp/boonies frequently and you can see every tree and bush and most animals. This uninformed conclusion is the result of losing your connection with nature and not living 'under the stars'. I'm sure most 'night-sailors' could also confirm this. ie...
People really need to get out of the city once in a while.
Whatever she is taking, I WANT SOME!
She's British. I believe they call it "gently mad".
Obviously, many people haven't spent an evening away from light pollution. "Yes", you can see black smoke at night and "No", you do not need to have the moon to see the black smoke. 90% of all American live under skies that are "negatively impacted" by light pollution... while over half can not even see the Milky Way from their homes. Which is a shame.
When away from the city, the moon can provide a surprising amount of light to see with although I do not know what phase the moon was in during that night.
Anyone who lives out of the city or has been in the deep woods can tell you it is anything but pitch black at night when your eyes are adjusted and the stars are out. I would consider this plausible at least if anything else is corroborated with her story.
I haven't a clue if she saw anything but if the stars were out and the night clear the black smoke would blot out the stars behind a plane making it visible. also I didn't see where she said how high it was but with two planes above it, it could've been few thousand feet or so. Who knows and at this point what difference does it make. (Last part sarcasm)
I think I read somewhere that it was a quarter moon that night, though the moon wouldn't make a difference in what she could see. Again, those who've never experienced a night "free from light pollution" have no idea. And again ... that is a shame. Because I swear, a still night and a clear sky can clense the soul better than almost anything.
But I don't live in a city, this woman was so far from this plane she couldn't tell flames from orange lights but she could see smoke?
The observations of sailers and night sky observers should not be marginalized. Digital cameras are bringing to light and truth what others scoffed at before. Light polution is growing around the world because so many lights are aimed at the sky.
Ocean Sky on a cloudless night can be well lit... especially if there is a fire in the sky...
some day your stupid mind will go outdoors and realize there are stars and a moon out there. you may also realize that you are dumb and the world will be a better place if you sleep all day and don't comment because you clearly lack brains and people will do better if you remain silent.
She sounds like a nut job!
That photo is of a plane with 4 props.
Just Yahoo's attempt to put a photo on the story. She didn't take a photo of whatever she saw.
you beat me to that comment by 60 secs
could be a pic of the search plane...
It's a P-3 Orion sub hunter. Stock photo used to mimic what a hallucinating sea voyager might see. Sensationalized journalism at it finest.
The pix at the lead is of a 'needle boat'.... They passed on the one they found of the gopher water-skiing...
what the hell are you looking at?
The original photo was of a plane underwater.
Holy cow! Flight 370 changed into a P-3 Orion (see photo)! No wonder it hasn't been found.
She's so full of it you could smell it on her breath if you stood next to her.
Right....because she didn't have a camera to take a picture? Or a radio to call it in? No way do I believe that someone sees what they believe is a "plane on fire" and they just chalk it up to a hallucination.
I don't think you have learned much yet young David. School will really help you out. Start with the word "understanding'. This word has real power behind it.
interesting the plane went missing in March its now June....... this this woman just wake up ??
Is this to same woman that found a finger in her chili at wendys
I would give you a thumbs down but that was my thumb in Wendy's chili.
@Liberal - too funny! great comeback. and crow...thanks for starting a hilarious thread!!
sure...wait 3 months to mention it.
”Maybe I should have had a little more confidence in myself. I am sorry I didn’t take action sooner.” Maybe you should take a polygraph lady.
....and maybe she's also just full of #$%$....
hope she recorded the latitude and longitude.
A 777 turned into a prop plane?
Ya. A 4 engine prop plane. Which is unusual in itself since the 777 is a two-engine aircraft.
Da Plane. Da Plane sure she saw it. Lol ! My opinon the plane never crashed. Its in some cozy hagar far away from sight. Just my thought.
Sarah Palin saw it from her front porch, says that obama was flying the jet, you betcha!
This writer must be desperate for a story!!!!
WOW, MUST BE NICE TO BE ON YOUR BOAT WITH ALL THE DRUGS YOU CAN DO!!
The husband is not saying much beyond "Yes, dear!"
She noted having spotted the missing airliner shortly after returning from her trip to Washington state where she spotted Big Foot !
Do not let CNN find out about this or they will be on this story for the next year.
Some idiots will say and do anything for attention :( REBT
Who is worse? Her, or the idiots who encourage and enable her ignorant behavior?
If you want to sound like a total nut just tell people you saw black smoke coming from a plane.......AT NIGHT!! Hilarious.
Exactly...I too thought the same thing...you would never see black smoke from a plane at night.
She was sailing with her husband! Did her husband see it too or did she tell her husband?
She is looking to make a buck with a book, no doubt.
Must have been on some really good stuff to think she was "insane" & couldn't tell a plane (on fire yet), when she saw one?????
Yeah, and a dingo ate your baby. Next!
as it turned out, that dingo did eat her baby, her second trial proved that and freed her ! but that was funny, i laughed...
Oh goodness, Tee is wanting her 10 minutes of fame. They do need to giver her a lie detector test. Why did she wait? Doesn't make sense - no camer on board - duh!
whats up with the power boat? thought she was sailing? poor coverage and worse tech advisers. But by now, its what I have come to expect from the news, false videos, false statements, false coverage. Arrghhhh!
Not once did I ever think to something till now, even though it was on the TV everyday for what 60 days or so. What a freakin moron! This either the dumbest person on earth or a story filled to brim with BS.
Was it V.Stiviano who reported this?
Sounds like a 20 minutes of fame story to me. Wonder how much she got paid to 'all of a sudden' decide to 'tell her story'.
dehydration does some wired things to our minds.
Its the daily caller, what do you expect??
Go over that part about being insane again, because with the noise going on as long as it did, you would have to be insane not to mention it, or wait this long before voicing this out!
She be right wit her first idea...she be crazy.
I wonder who put her up to saying this.
Is that what you spend your time wondering about. Good grief!!
I saw Bigfoot on my way to work this morning.
Oh.....okay. This sounds credible. Was bigfoot straddling the top of the aircraft?
Dozens of people claim to have seen it. Why does this one make the news?
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” At this point, I'd go with that as the most likely explanation for what she saw.
She must have had a Maureen Dowd marijuana brownie to hallucinate.
Just decides to come forward now, huh? Either way you cut it, this woman is a nut case.
Yet another "look at me" moment. Bullsheet all the way.
A woman with balls like a giraffe. Dream on DIMBO-what a ridiculous story. Now. of all times. Sailing is with a sailboat, cruising is with a motorboat, trippin' out is= drugs, alcohol or insanity.
@BRENDA BRILLIANT-YES "AUXILARY MOTORS" FOR SAFETY SAKE.
She only waited this long to come forward to make sure the traces of mushrooms and PCP were out of her system...
I saw green monkey's jumping from my wall the other night. I think I may be going insane.
She thought she was hallucinating? Why would that be the first thing she thinks of? Maybe cuz she WAS tripping?
Great! Now CNN will call her an "expert" and here goes another 3 weeks of Breaking News.
"...Tee feels bad for not saying something sooner." Why in the world would she not have said something sooner? I think she's hallucinating.
It just sounds like someone looking for their 15 minutes of fame. Next year she will report seeing Bigfoot.
This woman had been out in the Sun far too long, mix that with a few Vodka and tonics and she was looking at a fly on the end of her glasses. Besides she said it was at night when she saw the plane yet she was able to see black smoke coming from the plane. Come on now !!!! All she is looking for is a few minutes with Anderson Cooper on CNN.
I think Ms Tee had a few too many that day.
What's up with the animated luxury powerboat, with a woman laying on a lounge chair on deck doing "nightwatch"? This is what the media envisions a sailboat to look like?
Then again she might have been smoking something.
Oh, a 'woman'. Probably just a bottle rocket or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good lord…what low self esteem. She makes Charlie Brown look like Donald Trump.
She saw black smoke trailing behind the plane at night time? LMAO who is she Wonder Woman?
Odds say they will never find the plane,just put it in the Amelia Earhart file,
I see a padded cell in her future.
Wonder how much money she got from this .
Katherine's delay was based on her waiting to get word back from ET and the Loch Ness Monster granting her permission.
Another nut job -the world is getting worse....
Next she will have a Bigfoot sighting,
If the woman is speaking the truth, it implies that the plane is somewhere between Phuket and Kuala Lumpur in the water.
She also saw a Bigfoot in east Texas! BS! BS! BS!
Must have been heavy in to drugs to even make a statement like that--oh-i thought i was going crazy or halluinating???? Not a normal person--i wouldnt believe her--prob on drugs//////////////////////////// Hell--if you saw a plane--you saw a plane--how complicated is that/ and where was yhe husband--oh--he doidnt see anything----GOD--Idiots galore out there--i get so sick of it ////////////////
I didn't want to say anything but i saw Osama Bin Laden buying a a WTC book on 9/8. Should I have said something?
I wonder if she also dated Jimmy Hoffa
Maybe it was a UFO! LOL!
How much pot was she smoking at the time of her sighting?
then way didn't the other plans report a plane in distress( on fire) I' sure one of the two planes would of seen a some on fire in the air.doesn't sound right.
What was she smoking? Give me a break!
my neighbor saw jesus in her peanut butter sandwich too
Who did the graphics on this story...the SY-FI channel...? Any one who says-- by the way I saw a fire on an airliner a few months ago. Just figure it might be of interest. LOL
If her Husband was with her, then did he see it also? Or did she say LOOK????
Just a photo of a boat to get your attention.
this is BS if she had SEEN it, it woulda made news a long time ago. however, if she really did see it, and waited all this time, that makes her look like an even bigger #$%$.
She got her name in the paper.
" She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time ". I call BS !!! Just a stupid woman looking for her 15 minutes of fame.
Yes, so did I. It flew over my house but was afraid to say that I saw it too.
yeah and I have some land in the indian ocean to sell her
Why would she think she was going insane? Why hallucinating? Does she do that a lot? Unless she is in the habit of seeing Elvis, you'd think she would report it.
So either I believe her when she says she was going crazy or the stuff about the airplanes. Hmmm. Other planes over a burning one that goes unreported doesn't sound like a good thing.
I wonder what drugs she was taking?
It's only missing to those who don't know where it went.
What you do homie go on break or something? After all we know how hard you work and deserve a break.......loser
You got the homie hiccups.....take a big drink of water without stopping........about 1000 gallons ought to do......BBBWWWWAAAAA
boring. Get on your other accoutns already you worthless old man :)
ahahah loser ill #$%$ you in the #$%$ tonight b|tch!
this is bull pucky, why would she not reported this a lot sooner than now, I do not believe this for one second, go back to drinking your booze or spiked tea, she must have some reason to make this up hoping it will benefit her somehow
She didn't report it because "she didn't believe her eyes". Yeah, okay.
That's okay Katherine...it's not like the whole world was looking for this plane
Blowing the horn a little late.
"cough" #$%$.. an airplane on fire and you don't wake your husband take cell phone pics or something?
I'll go with "insane" for 20 points, please.
I think she was right when she assumed that she was insane.
My question. why did she not say anything about this till now?
I'm sure she probably also spotted "Big Foot" and the "Loch Ness Monster"
And she had been chilling for Godot to come along and hear her story as well
I'm pretty sure that's not a sail boat in the picture.
it's yahoo dude...at least there is a picture.
Iceman and Maverick, doing a practice run and done effed up.
If you see an "elongated plane glowing bright orange and trailing black smoke" and the most likely explanation is you are going insane, Honey, you are already there, no two ways about it
If she saw a Plane coming down in flames and other Planes above it, maybe it got shot down by a local nation?
What the hell is a "local nation"? Perhaps sixpack (empties) meant "loco"?
I guess I should have said nations in that area, wherever that was.
Well, I guess she has now had her 15 minutes of fame.
She also said she saw a figure that appeared to be Big Foot at the controls.
Does she live under a rock?
So the plane is last missing at 1:30AM, and this woman is in open waters in the middle of the night, and seeing a glowing orange plane and black smoke behind it?? In the middle of the night you cannot see black smoke. You cannot tell if it is a plane. A total BS Story.
The other planes are the ones that shot it down.
What is the phrase Im searching for here? ......... Oh yeah, it got it, #$%$.
Did she just arrive in port?
I must be missing something here. If I thought that I saw a plane on fire, I'd probably yell out for other people to look at it too. Maybe her husband?
Bs, she is just looking for her 15min. of fame
Could be a shot at publicity. However, in light of the seriousness of the situation. . .leave no stone unturned.
In other words. I was stoned out of my mind and could not be sure if what I saw was real...
What the hell, check it out.
This lady has been smoking to much Seaweed...
I ran into Jimmy Hoffa at a taco truck last year. I knew I should've asked him to take a selfie with me. He looked like he wanted to be left alone, though.
ME TOO! but it turned out to be a UFO....
If you are talking about the plane it would be 15 minutes of FLAME.
Bartender,, !! ....I will have the same as her ????
If you ask me she a little Cray Cray in the head why didn't she didn't she report it when she seen it. Maybe she is a little light in the loofers, she should go check herself in and get checked out...
How could she tell the smoke was black at night?
I saw a hundred foot Jesus in Tulsa, Ok !!!
And I saw Santa Claus riding in his sleigh with the Easter Bunny and the tooth fairy. Either this person needs 15 min of fame or they are crackers in the head!
No need to drag Santa into this.
CNN has started a kind of Cargo Cult, where is the plane...I think I saw it the other day while floating in my pool.
How many of these stories are we going to endure? Next thing you know, somebody will come forward because they saw Elvis getting on the plane. The plane disappeared without a trace....if it was on fire and coming down, debris would have been found.
Here we go again, another attention seeker with the so called "facts".
Lay off the Wine while sailing lady. How can you see black smoke at night time ? in the middle of the ocean. Yeah her story is legit. lol
Please make a better argument that that, KW. You can see Smoke at night in any of a numer of ways. The moon that night was nearly half full and, especially with the increased moon glow provided by the reflection of moon light off the ocean, there would have been ample light to see the smoke by. Plus, she mentioned the glow of what she suspects to have been flames coming from the plane...this, too, would have illumnated the smoke. Without moon glow it may have been difficult to say that the color of the smoke was "black" (although smoke is almost always dark in color) But, just like the clouds, the smoke would have been obvious just by the way it would have blocked one's vision of the starts behind it. Maybe you need to step away from your keyboard, Keyboard Warrior, and go somewhere devoid of light polution and experience the night sky. It's a beautiful thing and you'd be amazed at what you can see without the aid of sunlight.
I like your hypothesis. Thats all it is. LOL
Wait, is this the same lady who says her cat can do calculus?
this lady saw this plane in march & now we are in June...uuumm how many months has it been??? 3 months i guess & she just decided to bring it up now...why not just keep quiet like she did the past 3 months...& all she can say is "I AM SORRY I DIDN'T TAKE ACTION SOONER... pathetic i say!!!
"She thought she was hallucinating"...I think the rest of us know that she was.
What was in the wine she was drinking? If you can't tell the difference between a meteorite and an airplane, put the wine glass down.
So where was her husband and what did he see?
Whoaaa Nelly, why didn't you come forward with this information when the jet was all over the news as missing? You are so wrong to tell lies. You saw no jet on fire. The passengers are probably deceased but the jet landed safely somewhere. Now go take off your stupid pants and cash the large check you received to lie.
Hope that little boat had a big beer cooler on it, that's a long trip between gas stations..
Was that plane shot down? Other planes above it?
I saw it fly over my backyard. I want my 15 minutes of fame too.
hhhmmmmmhhh intersting story two planes above sounds logical enough to me best one yet
Looney Tunes looking for 15 minutes of fame. " I thought I was looking my mind." Go with that thought.
Nice picture. Where did they get it the toy store
"Come back to bed, baby. It's just a Boeing 777 falling out of the sky, don't bother anybody about it"
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Oh I see......wait...what?
And it looked like James Dean and Elvis were in the cockpit.
Geez! Imagine if she had told this say....when it happened! If true, it might have helped pin-point a signal or locate debris!
Are people starting to drop acid again? I know I seen a lot of strange stuff back in the 70,s.
This couple must need money to fill up their boat.
How does this stuff make the news?
I TOLD HER TO QUIT DRINKING , BUT SHE IS A REPUBLICAN FROM ENGLAND MARRIED TO MR. CRUZ !
I see someone going for their 15 minutes here...This has been all over the news for months..
I call BS! I don't know what the purpose is for this at this point, but it has a very bad smell.
FEMALES need to stop watching GAME OF THONES on a ship.
Let's face it..She's either crazy or a liar. The entire world has been searching for flight 370...and now she finds it in her heart to come forward with potential information. She's a liar!!
My point is that folk will say and do anything for attention like this lady :(
I just saw it in my backyard!
And this Lamo is just reporting this NOW??!!
What is even funnier than this nut case is the moron who wrote this story.
Sounds like she was on some heavy-duty drugs that night.
"A little more confidence in myself"? I'll say! Hard to believe that someone with the courage to sail across such an huge expanse with her spouse doesn't have enough sense to believe her own eyes! Was he asleep?
She must be high that night.
So did several fishermen but nothing was done about that either,,a dead end because of incometant government officials,,,
how do you see black smoke at night?
She said, "....more likely that I was going insane.” That I can believe.
OK your fifteen minutes of fame are up
SURE she did. That's the reason she told the authorities about it 3 months ago! NOT Nothing but another glory hunter liar like Ed Snowden.
I saw it too and Elvis was flying it.
One question, why did this take over 2 months to surface? (fails the smell test)
Maybe 2 alien planes were trainging it--or maybe 2 planes SHOT it down-----------------------the whole deal is ----has coverup written all over it------------GOD--was it hillery that saw it?????????????????????????????
Awesome comments everyone. I needed a good laugh.
youre coming forward now,because you didnt believe your eyes at the time?? so now I guess you finally determined that you believe them? what a twit.
at least check it out, what else do we have to do, ?
I would like some of what she is smoking, sounds like good chit.
If this is real, did she think to a location ? Or did this reporter just not ask the question ?
COME ON ! - It looks like a pic of a "Prop-Job" (Propeller-driven plane) taken while hallucinating on Acid.
She sees a light in the sky and so she thinks she was going insane and is just coming forward now? I don't think so.
WOW..new theory, plane is shot down but by who's military? Wouldn't other people have seen a plane on fire?
I saw it, too. And so did my dog.
Looks more like looking for FREE AD. lolol ............ she got it. :-D Pity the families, Malaysians ....... especially all concerned in took and are taking active part in finding. Shame on her n her other half.
Maybe why she said she hesitated reporting it! People would not believe her, anyway. Smart thing would have been to keep quit. But, then, just maybe, it will end up being important. So, a wise person would ignore the people that would try to degrade her for reporting.
I guess she forgot to mention the shrooms too.
Why didn't she shoot a video using her cell phone?
i think you know the answer already ... but anyway probably because she made the story up, for attention.
Question: did she make it up for attention or was this story planted so the world would continue to look for the plane?
She thought her cellphone was a hallucination... until she saw all those naked-on-a-boat-selfies on facebook.
You say something three months later, are you fn kidding me?
If a tree fell in the woods and there was no one there to hear it... Tee would be able to tell us if it made a sound!
Damn woman, nice time to bring this up!
Must have been a good hash.
The book she is writing will be out in August.
I think she might be right be only one thing that she is going insane!
FYI Katherine Tee...had you mentioned your "claim" earlier on...maybe..just maybe the authorities could look into it. Right now...you need to find a dark corner...place yourself into it facing the wall...and remain quiet. No one wants to hear from you at this point...like really....no one.
Why didn't the husband see it? The first thing I would have done was tell him, come and see if you are seeing what I see.
If she was alone on deck and had the night watch, that means the husband was asleep down below.
Don't care, I would have woke him up and told him to get himself up on deck and look up.
Ms Tee is full of "BS," or was on LSD at the time she supposedly saw this.
I pity the fool that call Ms Tee full of BS.
What a dope!! Maybe snap a cell phone pic or something? If for no other reason than to prove you are or are not insane? Statistics show that 10% of people choose to remain stupid and here's proof.
Does she have the position log from her boat? Where was the sighting? See if it makes sense with the satelite data. Given there seems to be no other leads, have someone spend time looking at the data. Then either look in the area she is saying the plane is or push her out the door and slam it on her butt.
This lady sounds like a freaking idiot. How are you going to wait this long to tell somebody? Someone punch this lady in the face...
High, drunk, and stupid - sailing her way through life. I should be so lucky.
nothing like waiting for couple months
Ask the Plane Channel, CNN, they should have all of the answers by now.
lets not call it in at all till now. i call bs on her story
I don't believe a word of her story. Not a shred of evidence to back her claim up, so you're left looking at credibility and common sense... and her having waited so long simply doesn't jive with either. 'Gee, I saw the plane the entire world is looking for on fire - I wonder if I should say something... hmmmm... let me think about it for a couple of months.' Yea, that's the ticket!
News Flash....British are Indulging in Colorado's Trending Marijuana Edibles. Today a British woman claims to have seen the lost Malaysian Air Flight MH370. She says she isn't sure if she was hallucinating. But was very matter of fact about the "Edibles" saying "I know had those wonderful treats, for sure. And so it goes........
Are we sure this wasn't Courtney Love that saw this?
Where the hell were she for the last three months?
Listen to the comments on here, would you say anything?
I think she's full of #$%$.
Hey - did we ever follow up with Courtney Love's claim that she found it?
I just don't believe this woman. She had to be aware of the hunt for the plane even after the fact and she said nothing. I doubt if this is real.
And an oil rig worker saw it near VietNam
The rig worker is the only one I am inclined to believe.
Me too, the oil rig worker who is obviously familiar with objects in the sky at night certainly saw something unusual and as he reported it at the first opportunity I'm also inclined to believe him. The strange thing is I don't recall any serious attempt to search in that area.
drug use is a terrible thing
I'd go with the first assessment- insane.
So two other planes above fired rocket or whatever, causing Flight 370's downing? Hm. Could be...Wouldn't discount it whatsoever.
She said the other planes were well above it ......... meaning at cruising altitude.
I regret not being able to swim fast enough to catch it in my hand but my giant #$%$ was about to turn back into a pumpkin. well... I climbed back down the beastly bean sprout and here I am
That plane is in a hanger somewhere, and the hostages will be traded for mass murdering taliban
Pretty funny. My favorite was still the black hole theory! Keep these coming please!
Never a shortage of speculation from the Daily Lair
I have to believe if I saw a plane looking like that, I'd call authorities ASAP
If the picture of the boat is considered "sailing" we are seriously all in trouble!!!!!!!!!!
What a load of cow #$%$!
If it were on fire, where are the pieces or luggage etc.
Negligence : The failure to act/react in a reasonable manner . Put her picture next to that definition .
Well, that's one way to get yourself in the news....come up with a story that cannot ever be corroborated, and have the lemmings on The Daily Caller and Yahoo News fawn over you.
I wonder if she went to Colorado with Dowd and they both ate the BROWNIES
HERE IS ANOTHER #$%$ TRYING TO GET FAMOUS WITH A DUMMY NEWS
I know vodka speak when I here it.
Right off the bat her story is suspect. But I still have to ask?? Where is the plane?
so tell the authorities the coordinates of where you think you saw something
Why is the picture of a power boat if she is a sailor. This story sounds like fish that has been off the ice too long.
and the cheese has slid off the cracker
Well she got her 15 minutes of fame. It's a scam.
This lady also claims she saw Sasquatch .... oh and Jimmy Hoffa at Starbucks.
Those were not the normal mushrooms on her pizza, or maybe they were drinking sea water!!!
As I have been saying all along...the plane was shot down.She probably witnessed the fighter jets..
? some how i think she might have seen a few search boats
black smoke at night might want to rethink this lie a little more
I saw it 2 weeks ago when I was driving home from the bar. I would have said something sooner but I forgot.
Just how dumb can you be to see something like this and not report it?
yeah and it had the Roswell dummy as the pilot.
She'll be easy to gut when this goes to trial. Good job.
Took awhile to bring it up...didn't it?
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Really? That's a strange thought? Maybe that's why she didn't report it sooner.
what, pray tell, were the other 2 aircraft in the area doing...& why didn't THEY report this incident??
"May be I should have said something sooner"....... DUH!!!!!!!!! YOU THINK????? Unbelievably stupid woman.
FIRST problem.......a plane on fire ? the inevitable crash would leave debris SECOND problem ....if true (ahem) and 2 other planes leaving the area, this alleged delay is suspect for anyone smart enough to navigate and sail across any ocean. THIRD problem....Navigator's of a craft that size, keep logs of events, ships Latitude & Longitude locations, So the mystery continues. Personally, I think it ran out of gas, stayed in tact like Sully Sullenberger's landing on the Hudson, and ........yep, sank. Maybe the Nautilus Sub from Jules Vernes movie will find it ?
Has she signed a book deal yet.
Was she dreaming in her sleep during night watch? She must have consumed too muck whiskey...
Oh,sure.... and those UFO's flew right alongside. She is sure of that.
This bubble head is sailing the ocean?
Thanks a lot to tell us, but are you kidding me?
She just got her 15 minutes.
"She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time." Took her 2 months to process what she saw? Ya, OK. Sounds a little fishy to me.
Knowing the tension in that region, It is possible that the plane was downed by one of the military fighter jet from that region .
Is this story for real or am I hallucinating that some one really wrote this story .
AND Elvis was waving out the window to her when the plane struck a UFO, crash landed and killed Big Foot.
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” - Yep, that's a reliable witness, alright.
why would she think she was hallucinating?
Chances that this story is true...zero.
I don't know, if you see a plane on fire wouldn't you alert authorities, unless she didn't know, who she would alert. Sometimes, we see things in the air and not sure what to think of it. I saw a UFO, while driving through the park one evening and I thought do I report it to someone. Who might that be?, if I called 911, they would laugh their #$%$ off at me.
If I were a betting man, this plane will never be found.
Whether or not you're a betting man has nothing to do with this plane ever being found.
It's a BIRD! It's a Plane! It's.... RUSSIA! I can see from my house!
"I then continued to smoke my bong".
I believe that is the Lockheed P3 Orion. Search plane. I used to work on them at Lockheed, Burbank, CA in a prior life. You can just barley make out the stinger at the tail end
Is she one of the person who has also seen Elvis Presley live in recent yrs.?....This lady must be good in shooting bulls.
That smoke was coming from the joint she was smoking. She waits three months to say something? Come on man!
While I was on me back on the upper deck in the moonlite I tole me hubby to lie still a minute so I could peer past is head. Sure nuff right oer is left ear I see an aeroplane on fire.
I saw Elvis at the local Walmart the other day, he was with the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy!
Why would Elvis be with a CHILD MOLESTER? He is better than that.
One way to get your name in the paper.
yeah...really. It could explain why no wreckage was found. But the I.O.?
Sure, if you believe that this woman actually a burning plane and never bothered to tell anyone about it. Personally, I think she's caught the American lust for fifteen minutes of fame.
I mean, I haven't read through the 4300 comments to this "story", but no one is really BELIEVING this, right??
You can see all sorts of things looking through the bottom of an empty beer bottle while sailing in a "motor boat".
"and now I feel really bad" what?? I think she is looking for attention and is making the whole story up!! what a dope!!
her guide Bigfoot was quoted,"it was aliens"
omg yahoo ....do you run this past an editor before you post this #$%$ ?
If she thinks its more likely that she's nuts, then she probably is !
I hope she did, and that this does not become I saw Elvis thing!
I witnessed the second shooter from the grassy knoll, but didn't report it at the time because I wasn't born yet.
Why the cartoon of a speedboat for this story?
its with a terrorist group we set free,,,sheeeple
Not biting!......They have a radio onboard. If it shocked her that much she could have radio'd someone.
Too much salt air on the brain if you ask me.
Yeah...she saw this plane and waits MONTHS before coming forward. Since this alleged sighting took place at night - how did she know there was black smoke coming out of the object?
amazing how yahoo continually pushes this #$%$
She sounds like a #$%$. She she's something is the sky and thinks she going insane?? Maybe she is insane.
Yea and I saw Bigfoot too. How can you see smoke in the sky at night?
I was getting loaded on my boat on good wine and some other stuff. I saw Peter Pan fly through the air on his way to Never Never Land,
I saw flight MH370 fly by and it was close enough to see that Elvis was the pilot.
Just another bs-story to grab attention ....
How do you see black smoke in the middle of the night?
That's a bit of an odd story.
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Let's just go with that one.
Why bother, after all you were having fun!!!
Why hasn't the GeoResonance company followed up on their finding?
Smells like a fart to me. This is nothing more than bs from yet another attention getter.
I wonder what she was smoking at the time?
She felt a need to get her name in the news. Time to give up the search.No one is alive at this point.
someone should be slapping her constantly till she disappears.
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah !! Are you that bored with your job!
CNN expert clowns will validate this report soon
Maybe the Malaysian Military made a mistake and shot the plane down. Oops! let's cover it up!!!!
Unbelievable. I'd have to check her ports of call.. how could anyone not have thought that was relevant.
If this is how this lady told this story, she completely a duummmbazz. And sounds like one..
Yep, we sure could have used that info. earlier, captain obvious.
I thought I saw tupak and Elvis hanging out on this deserted island.
If this is so, this woman is as cruel as they come.
I seen the plane in my dreams. It went through a wormhole and landed safely in the Twilight Zone.
musta been good weed she forgot to report it lol
Lady! It was your husband firing up a giant spliff to take the edge off sharing a boat in the middle of nowhere with YOU!
Fire up that Bad Boy !!! lol !!!
I remember that one time that I didn't see bigfoot.
"Oooooh! You have discombobulated my cosmic vaporizorrrr!"
Oh this sounds like a creditable witness....
You're a little late on breaking the story lady
I'd like to believe this woman's story, but the eyewitness version my cat recently told me thoroughly conflicts her recollection of a "elongated bright orange glow." My cat said it looked like a "stubby gray lizard." I find the cat more believable.
I think she is full of cotton.
he we go again,total intelectual failure.please lets face the facts...we are no as advanced as we claim to be,i mean who looses a plane with 239 people in this world today with out a trace.NO ONE. look at the money spent on this endevour. when are we going to stop.any idiot knows that space aliens took the dam plane.so lets move on #$%$
I saw Elvis at the gas station today.
1000:1 odds she's making this up!
ok...so three months later she just NOW remembers?! She just want attention.
This lady better watch what she says, before she mysteriously turns up missing for disclosing the truth
She didn't tell anyone for 3 months because she didn't want CNN beating down her door.
Oh yeah, and I saw Elvis last night at Walmart. He was picking up some twinkies.
I guess i should say i know where jimmy haffa is so that i can get on Yahoo News! Geesh...what a bunch of crock this lady is. She waited aaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllll this time to now say this? Why didn't she say it the minute she saw something? She had a radio...surely she could of reported it......They should arrest her for making a FALSE report. We should call her a decendant of the Kardashians.
By the way, I saw who shot JFK. I am just coming forward now because at the time I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Oops, my bad! There is absolutely no way this lady is making this up!
Sorry I don't believe her. 3 months later she comes forth????
look at the shiny object everyone ... don't worry about all these scandals just keep looking at the shiny object.
This isn't the first person to claim seeing a plane on fire in the sky.
so who has the flight records of the two other planes on that day flying that route? lets look at the satellite handshake from them and compare with the missing plane. hello bueller. thats only if its true.
There has been a huge cover up with this "Missing Aircraft". There are many people from different countries that are involved. In the future this aircraft will be used in another "Terrorist Incident". Nothing just disappears without a trace........
We can find a planet millions of miles away from our solar system but can't find a plane? You may be right, either way there is B/S involved!
My socks do, but only one of a pair at a time.
" But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.”" How do so many crazy people end up rich enough to yacht around the world?
Not buying it for a second.
Please someone call Nancy Grace so she can scream and scream on TV
Oh for goodness sakes. She swept it under the carpet, my butt. I believe she is a faker.
a slow day in the news room
THEN THERE SHOULD BE DEBRIS ALL OVER, RIGHT?
Thumbs up if you saw it too!
has anyone checked on gilligans isle?
They can find wreck ships from deep seas but not this big plane.
I'm sorry, but I don't accept the "I didn't believe my eyes" line. Especially as you weren't alone. They didn't believe their eyes either?
All these sonar, satellite, high tech devices didn't help at all to find one big plane??
That's the most rediculas and unbelievable story yet
I saw it too! I was admiring the picture of Jesus in my corn muffin this morning when I looked past Big Foot and saw this buring orb in the sky. It gave off heat and light! Come to think of it, I saw it yesterday too! And the day before that!
That's strange man, I saw the same thing.
Did the carpet catch fire when she swept the plane under it?
"I am sorry I didn't take action sooner", like sober up or stop taking drugs. "I thought I was more likely going insane"...time to 12-Step.
Sailing is Usually done in a SAILBOAT--Standing night watch on Auto-Pilot
"I thought it was more likely I was going insane." Well that says it all.
James, I believe you helped him do it. Just kidding.
I would have to see the flight manifest.
Very scary and intimidating to witness something like that....just reading the story, I felt a bit overwhelmed imagining seeing this myself.....it got worse when she says there were two other planes there......
they don't want anyone getting the nuke that was smuggled on board. it will never be found
OK, she didn't 'believe her eyes' after hearing all this on the news? I think she is full of *ull *hit
i am going insane listening to her statement
She waits until now to report what she saw because "she couldn't believe her EYES"??????? What kind of an excuse is that? She is looking for attention.
might as well believe her , the alternative officials have not come with anything better. something is very shady with this missing flight- other planes lead one to believe some other force was involved- shades of operation northwoods - very puzzling.
This is about the most stupid thing I have heard, she did know the whole world was looking for the jet... She needs to go sit down some where... good grief...
I highly doubt the boat in the pic is the one she was sailing on.
I vote for: She's losing her mind.
How do you see black smoke in the middle of the night?
Yep, uh-huh! And did I tell you I saw Elvis, too?
I call B.S..Attention seeking people make me sick.
Huh? Her story sounds like nonsense. No proof of anything she says so I'm not buying it.
She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time.... AND .....She thought she was hallucinating....... Sure.. OK.... The perfect witness...
Give me a break. Some arbitrary woman makes national headlines because she "claims to have seen the missing plane"? What is the real agenda here?
Liberal Media thrives on truth. Tsk, Tsk.
gotta call #$%$ on this woman's story
Why in the world would anyone take so long to say anything unless shes lying and just wants attention
I think I saw this plane fly over my house a couple of months ago.
It was being ridden by a Yetti and crashed into the Loch Ness Monster, killing an entire herd of chupacabras. Oh the humanity!
"I thought it was more likely that I was going insane." -- Don't dismiss that possibility too quickly...if you actually expect people to believe this story.
It's just as I thought...those other planes weren't planes but alien spacecraft....they were all abducted by aliens!
And where is any debris..........NONE........No debris in the water, nothing floating at all. Maybe it smacked into land? No signals from Box on land were located. "shrug of shoulders"....."yawn"
She's gotten her 15 minutes of fame
Gee a missing plane over the Indian Ocean and you see a glowing ball in the sky at the same time and think nothing if it, sweep it under the carpet and just now decide to say something. Does she live under a rock????
Hard to know what to make of this.........as it sure seems strange...perhaps some planted dis-info to throw us all off....
TOOK TWO MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT THEIR FLIGHT PATH/ CHARTS INTERSECTED???? I DON'T BUY THAT. ESPECIALLY IF IT BOTHERED HER THAT MUCH. WHAT A CON.
wow, what a credible source..wonder how many drugs she was on
She could have witnessed two fighter jets that made the mistake of shooting down a passenger jet and then circled around back to check out the blunder. She is very brave for coming forward because if this is true someone somewhere will want to find out what else she might have seen. I think 007 needs to be called in on this one.
To whoever thumbed me down about this lady being a LOON, did you even read what she said? She thought she was hallucinating or going insane, and couldn't believe her eyes! The woman had her husband right there in the boat with her. Wouldn't she have pointed out what she was seeing and asked her hubby "do you see that?". Get real, she's a nut job and just wants her 3 minutes of fame.
Lets quit questioning the woman and figure out if what she saw is legit. Use her info and compare to radar, route maps, etc, see if it makes any sense. Seems to me someone else had some sort of sighting in this same area.
Why would a person think they were going insane if they saw a big airplane on fire?
I wouldn't want to be in a boat out on the water with Mrs. Dumba$& .
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane." I think it's more likely she was drunk as a skunk.
So what? Does this help recovery or just creates another goose chase? This story should have been "swept under the carpet" instead of someone trying to "create" news.
Hey Yahoo! That is the picture of a speed boat (no sails). She said she was sailing-next time try and get the correct picture for your story. It gives credence to your story-Journalisn 101
It's a "digitized simulation" of a boat anyhow. Not even a REAL one...
Yes, and I saw bigfoot at the mall, didn't report it, thought the guy he bought hiking boots from would have phoned it in. My bad.
CNN will get right on it. Only 45,000 watchers the other day. Fire Zucker and his 16 yr old son he put on the CNN BOARD AS A CONDITION TO HIS BEING HIRED. My God the guy Failed NBC.
Yes, and I saw Elvis in aisle 5 the last time I shopped at K Mart.
Chapter 127 of the MH370 saga.
OMG!! Another load of crappola on Yahoo today..
More red herrings.... we ARE really stupid...
Confirms my intial thought at the time that a country's military shot it down ( likely by accident) then trailed it of course and wreckage was cleaned up.....The political implications of shooting ( by accident or intentional) down a civilian plane that was occupied by 2/3 Chinese was not good and that a international coverup/conspiracy would invariably ensue....more logical then the other nonsense theories like by chance locating without wreckage the plane pinger in the middle of the Indian ocean.....yeah right.....
Pretty selfish lady. What's next, someone saying they have the plane in their garage?
Yeah, right. She doesn't have the first clue about what she saw. They will never find that jet.
are there more Kardashans wedding story?
I saw bigfoot swimming across the Pacific Ocean once.
I do not believe this woman. Im watching her.. now.. Please do not believe what you said.. She is lier
I saw the plane along with Bigfoot and a UFO,
Sailing.....no rules out there. You can smoke all the weed you like. I'd see orange planes too.
And it was now that i realized...hey, i could make some $$ off this
....................and reuters pitched in to make the video? rueters is desperate too
Sorry, not buying it. This was all over the news, and just now a light bulb went off in her head? THREE months later?
Now, here's a lady who isn't just spewing bs to get attention. Nope. Couldn't happen. Noooooo way.
Just another crackpot looking for her 15 minutes of fame
Maybe she waited because there was something in her boat that wasn't strictly legal... Just sayin'...
Let's wait until JUNE to step forward. Really???? She will be on CNN tonight with Wolf and the boys!
Maybe she was transporting something on her sailing journey and didn't want any attention, if you know what I mean...
I think I saw it flying into San Diego
The aircraft was Droned by the Obama Adminstration, it was a "kill mission"
Not buying it at all. IF she saw this. Why wait so long? I'd be in a rush to look at a map etc.
Lady, it's JUNE 4th, almost 3 months and you're just now deciding to tell? Kind of strange in itself. JS
Just as some have said, shot down.
Jeez A 4 ENGINED PROPELLOR AIRCRAFT?? I was under the impression we had a Jet aircraft that went of the radar here...
I saw it flying over Eastern Tenn.
Geez lady, lie much??? Happy now that you got your 37 seconds of fame? She's full of #$%$.
How does one sail in a motor boat? (picture)
OMG - it's a model of what happened.
Was Elvis sitting on the wing?
yea baby that was some good chit that night
I saw the Loch Ness Monster riding a unicycle.
Pic is a C 130 cargo plane
It's a P3 Orion, which makes sense since that's one of the planes involved in the search.
In other words, nobody would PAY her fro her BEE-ESS story until now...
Well I think she got her 3 minutes of fame
They always tell you, believe people when they tell you about themselves. You date a guy, he says, "I'm a bad guy" you should really believe him. He's telling you something. When someone reports an incident, and says repeatedly, "I'm insane, I'm hallucinating", listen to them bc they too are telling you something.
How often do we see something strange and just think, "I must be going insane"?
It could be that someone or some people don't want the plane to be found. If it did crash in the ocean they'll never find it because the currents have carried parts of the plane far away by now.
Give me some of whatever she's on!!
Who takes a sailing trip from India to Thailand and doesn't bring a camera ?
I think I saw Big Foot a few months ago, but I never said anything because I thought its feet should have been bigger!!
She sounds like a complete whackjob.
what was she smoking ? and why all of a sudden she says something now? didn't have a radio on board the boat ? might of been ufo's flying around there too
They should inject her with truth syrum and put her #$%$ under a bright light.
what a bunch of horses****t. what the hell dose she want???then I guess I saw it too!!!!
She shoudlve kept her mouth shut. It clearly wasnt meant to be found for some other dangerous reason
And why should we believe you now?
I saw Elvis at the McDonald's on Northgate Blvd. in Sacramento Monday night...
You're hallucinating! I saw him on a grilled cheese sandwich... wait that was Jesus. Never mind.
Aaaand...there's her fifteen minutes of fame.
Oh please...this ladies so full of crock. If that plane last 7 hours flying while on fire...the sun is pink and the cow jumped over the moon.
where does it say 7 hours?
The plane reportedly flew 7+ hours before it "crashed" into the ocean.
Did that woman see it just before it crashed or there is evidence that she claimed to have seen it at the start of the seven hours in that linked article? I couldn't open that link.
This lady sounds Bat #$%$ Crazy.
Oh no, here comes 24hr coverage from CNN for 2 more months......
...............nobody believes this #$%$, do they???
shut your lying mouth off lady...
two months later!? i don't think so, she probably needs some attention/or money
Sounds like a load of #$%$ to me.
I believe her. A few others have seen a "burning object" falling off in the Bay Of Bengal between India and Myanmar (Burma). Search that area not West/Southwest Australia!
Does this woman just happen to work for the United States State department because this sounds like something Susan Rice would say and the press secretary for the department would spin, spin, spin........
What.... Does this sound bogus or is it just me...
She stated she saw something not flight MH370
The headline shows a photoshop speedboat. What is it about the fact she was "sailing" they don't get?
I still say it went down in Lake Erie.
what a fool.... how does this help anything... you are an idiot
This is the story you make up to get on the news? Sheesh. C'mon now... just stop it already.
If you're seeking 15 min. of fame, I'm sure you could make up something better than this dumb story. And if it's true then why didn't those other 2 planes report it? She should have left that part out of the story. `ya think?
It's a bird! It's a plane! Darn, it's my crazy uncle Ed doing a swan dive into the pool.
I just took a dump. I saw the plane in the toilet bowl.
Hilarious. I just got back from the McDonald's QP with cheese special. I will try the same thing.
The Israelis believe it has Islamic hands on it, and believe its being refueled and armed, they are on alert 24/7.
Land plane on makeshift runway / Camouflage runway / Paint plane DHL, FedEx or etc / Load plane with bad stuff / Park plane into a Superb owl
perhaps her 15 minutes of fame? or if real, just stupidly?
didn't she tell her husband so he could see it too? this story sounds a little "insane" to me
....and of course in an age where everyone has a camera in their phone, tablet, etc.....no pics/video were taken. Whatever.
So, she saw smoke behind the plane?. Wasn't this flight at night? She was able to see the smoke behind the plane? Can you see clouds at night when it is dark outside? I think she was probably drinking too much wine.
When you are out sailing and doing drugs and alcohol and see stuff, you start to question your mind ... gezzzzzzz
And so the loons start to come out ...
What an effing idiot ! The biggest mystery and news story for two months or so and she just now mentions it, wow, how the "h"ell do they have the brains to sail a boat ?
As "insane" as she might be, her story is as credible as all the other theories out there.
Soooo, now, do you believe it was shot down???
Holy #$%$ I just saw Sasquatch!!! Why print this nonsense??
Yes I was just sailing my boat that night and I saw the jet doing circles around me, then a bag with 200,000 landed in my boat it was so cool....Hold it that was DB cooper...Never mind.
And she is just now mentioning it? Right! If I seen something like that I would call it in ASAP. Stop wasting my time with your lies.
This lady was drunk and a idiot !
I don't know how much you've had to drink today, but you certainly are an idiot.
"She looked up the flight plan of the aircraft and discovered their journeys intersected". No it didn't.
The "flight plan" didn't take the plane over the Indian Ocean. The plan was to fly to China near Vietnam.
Has she had her head in a hole? Almost 3 months and she's just NOW coming forward.
Note to Mrs. Tee, quit smoking dope!
Yeah, i saw it also. I was in the back seat with my honey and looked out and saw it. We were in a parking garage in N.Y.C. Just respond and I will tell the reporters my story. How much publicity will I get? LOL
Maybe she was on some good drugs.
I say BS she just wants attention
This story makes the "Aliens Abducted them story" believable
I SUGGEST WEARING BODY ARMOUR IF YOU GET CLOSER THAN 20 FEET OF THIS BROAD..
At night? And was seeing smoke behind?
We may want to also question her about Santa, the Easter Bunny and Jimmy Hoffa.
...and the moral of the story is kids, don't smoke crack.
Yeah Right..come on..why ? being this is such a huge tragedy why would anyone withhold such important information for so long any ways what good does it do even if its true..your dealing with the elitist and they are the puppet masters so the missing 370 flight will stay a mystery forever..theres nothing to loose for those involved..so as long as truth is never revealed....
Thought Sail Boats had a sail, looks like an inboard to me. Damn Stoners. KYBob
And one you don't want to take too far from land.
Ok now put down your can of fosters lager ale!
I saw that plane too ... the one that was on fire ... so I know she is crazy !
How? does this woman have night vision?She said she and her husband was sailing at night and she was able to make out details of the missing jet and 2 others. This story is completley fabricated.
Her book will be coming out in September!!!!
Tee and ganja don't go well in the middle of the Indian ocean
What I found a bit sad in all of this is that if this lady IS telling the truth, and if it indeed was the missing flight, if there were any possibility that anyone survived she could have possibly saved someone's life had she notified the Coast Guard or somebody..... I mean if I saw a burning plane in the ocean, and especially if I "thought" but wasn't sure that it was a plane, I think I'd err on the side of notifying someone....worse case is you're wrong, but better safe than sorry....
did she say she saw it in the ocean?
I hope she was not out in the Ocean with out a communication device to reach land , she should have alerted someone !
why the heck would you not report it. it has been on the news and in the media for months, to come forward now is just dumb. say something when you saw it or shut the front the door.
Sounds like this lady may have been on LSD.
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Bingo.
DRUGS are real. DRUGS are bad people.
Again the Brooklyn Bridge is for sale!
They fail to tell us that this comes from a woman who saw Elvis and the Big Bopper in Bangkok.
Yeah freakin' right. How can you tell if a plane had black smoke coming out behind it in the dead of night?
Ok, your 15 minutes are up...now move along and take your white jacket with you!
I'm guessing Elvis was sitting on the wing with his feet dangling in the air while he sang Flip, Flop and Fly too. I think she IS crazy
This is about when we can expect folks to come up with alien stories and other garbage,
hmmmm.... I don't know about this one. If it was real, it was worth reporting at the time.
Why did it take 3 months for her to come forward? I'm not sure I am buying this.
I totally saw that plane today parked out behind the walmart
The whole world is looking for this plane, this lady sees a plane on fire and she doesn't think to tell anyone, Well, Well, I call BS on this one.
Its perfectly normal to not say anything to anyone when you see a large airplane flying over apparently on fire. I wouldn't say anything about it either because............Damn! I can't think of any reason I wouldn't say anything. Unless if I couldn't believe my eyes, I wouldn't expect anyone else to? Nah. That's weak. Nope. I would think the average person would have a hard time not talking about a spectacle like that.
Because she would be called a liar and she probably thought some men in black would show up at her door threatening her?
True the plane went down on March 7th, (GMT), but the plane most likely went down on March 8th (MYT) Even if the plane went due west, the crash still would have occurred on March 8th The last contact was on March 8th 1:19 AM (MYT) I would hope she knew on whether it happened before or after Midnight, as this is a big piece of the puzzle.
The whole world was looking for this plane and she just went with life. Sometimes I wonder….
How long will this alleged sighting take to be looked into?
Hope she included the navigational co-ordinates with that report- it's a big ocean!
She didn't tell us that she was stone drunk at the time
"She couldn't believe what she was seeing?" Because she didn't see it!!!
I think the trails of smoke were coming from her hash pipe.
Kind of fishy story, too much pot on the sail.
Military probably shot it down and nobody is confessing
Sounds like rich Brits in their private yacht...sound credible.
Dumb try at a cover up.
Obviously, paid by Malaysian authorities to say she saw it
THIS IS HER FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FAME
Maybe she saw the TItanic sinking instead.....
I suspect if she did indeed see something (plane or not) she was drinking..so of course she thought she may be insane..and still could be.
I'm on the Phone With Nancy Grace and TMZ they are going to get to the bottom of this...
Will she be writing a book soon? Titled the bull that I made a million on?
This just in........ET seen walking down Madison Avenue, NYC.......
she saw a mirage. she also said there were two other planes and the crew of either one or both of those two planes would have come forward already. skeptic about that statement.
Okay....I'll say it....this woman is an out-of-touch idiot.
WOW! All this woman is doing in the story is cutting herself down and thought she was crazy so NO, I don't believe her story!
this same woman also claimed that later in the day she was brought aboard an alien spacecraft and told to be quiet about it for a month or so , or they would come back to earth and eat her children
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” I often feel that way while reading YAHOO comments.
looking for 15 minutes are we?
I cannot believe anyone is giving this crackhead the time of day.
I don't believe any of the #$%$
With a helpful video of what a boat might look like
I saw a UFO with aliens do you believe me
Is she sure it wasn't Elvis or Amelia Earhart ?
Knowing there was a missing plane and seeing that and then just now coming forward with that info? Hogwash!
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Sounds a little unhinged from the start. Most folks don't default to "I'm going insane" when they see something..
And to think she could have done something to stop it. Lazy beeeotch!
Good now maybe fat looser Oprah will interview her. $$$
and I got a pinging in my ears
"while she was sailing." ... and that's why the editor added a vector picture or a motor boat. I am having my doubts whether this is taken seriously.
Anything for 15 minutes of fame......Dang!
of course. Poseidon was using it as a toy.
So, where have this lady been the last 3 months, in a cave? Lady, they did not and have not found the plane......you waited 3 months to report this?? You feel bad for not reporting this? Really!!!!
sounds like shes looking for her 10 mins of fame
Right...........because I know that when I see something with my own two eyes, I immediately think I must be crazy.......this woman is a loon....whether it's true or not. Surprised it took so long to get an "I saw it" story........
I guess hubby couldn't believe his eye either. That explains why it was so quiet around their house when she saw hubby naked for the first time.
man claims woman would love more notoriety. Idiot.
Sounds very similar to a story line from 'Lost''
Woman also claims to have been smoking copious amounts of marijuana that day
Are they checking out the area where she says her boat was at the time she says she saw the plane?
There's a plane on fire in the middle of the ocean should I bring my boat over in case people are drowning.......no I must be hallucinating.
I saw Jimmy Hoffa last year.
Yeah, right lady! One flew over the cookoos nest! If she is so unstable she thinks she is hallucinating...lock her up! She obviously has issues.
Not a sailboat! Does she know what she's talking about?
most likely looking for a book deal!
Well this story will get buried and so will she.
What a confused nut. I claim that I am King of the Moon. Mind you, I can claim that but it does not make it a true statement. I feel sorry for the man who married this crazy cow.
What action would that be? More drugs or drinks.
How many BS stories about this airplane have we heard so far? Well, we've just heard one more!
Pleeeeeease don't let CNN hear about this...
I also think I'm "going insane" when I see something that looks strange. Whatever...........I think this lady is nothing more than a wingnut.
Yeah right, a book and movie rights to follow!
you all just enjoy being contrary don't you.
There's a monster outside my window can i have a glass of water?
If this was true, (I'm sure its not) then all the families that lost a loved one, should beat the #$%$ out of this MORON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sarah Palin saw this same thing from her back porch . She reported this on Fox News .
at this point,"what difference does it make anyway" as somebody quoted
The Daily Caller parrotted by Yahoo. I'm convinced!
what an idiot - why is this even allowed to be reported here?
because really stupid people read it
I have had the same experience with seeing Bigfoot, it turned out to be a big hairy burley man in flip flops, but oh the stuff you see after a twelve pack.
cocaine is a helluva drug !!!! LOL.
Was the Easter bunny and Santa clause there too?
I still like the zombie angle better
and another thing there still would have been debris
what was she and hubby smoking that night?
they both just finished their fattys !!!!
It took her this long to make up a good-sounding lie.
Has anybody even checked the runway yet? Maybe it's still waiting to take off....
I bet this woman saw Elvis P. on the plane also.
Okay...she got her 15mins of fame...just move along now, nothing to see here...
So, how much does she want for the identity of the location ?
The real question, since the story did not indicate she withheld that information, why is the media refusing to divulge it?
Probably because it was on a heading for Diego Garcia?
Can Yahoo at LEAST post a picture of a real Sailboat vs. a toy boat with fake people?
I'm leaning towards the part where she said she was going insane.
I'm not real quick to believe someone who's first thought when they see something is "I'm probably going insane." ???!?!!???
horse #$%$ just some dumb #$%$ that wants to be in the news they must have been on some good mushrooms.
great she got her 10 min of fame. frankly she is full of sheet.
THIS IS JUST TO GET ATTN....SHE didn't do anything about it for 2 months..come-on...she said she heard it being reported...that a plane went down along time ago...PLEASE...GIVE ME A BREAK...WHAT PEOPLE DO FOR ATTN....
Who would take this long to report seeing a burning plane?
Someone who spent the last couple of months in detox?
this thing is starting to go the way of Elvis sightings
OH I guess this boat is what the rich mean....I had in mind a little boat with you know 1 sail thingy...lol.
Maybe she knows where Jimmy Hoffa is as well
Are you saying you saw a black chemtrail over the indian ocean?
at this point...well after the fact...i'd question anyone's statement.
Liar! She is lying like a rug!
I SAW SANTA CLAUS LAST DEC. TOO OVER THE SAME SPOT.
Move along people, nothing to see here
And this is why I stay away from Mai Tai's. Seeing smoke and other planes at night?
I saw it too!! Right before it went into that big black hole...
come on now your out sailing no phone no camera no radio to report stupid people,stupid yahoo
there's something fishy about this story.....and i'm not talk'n about her wagina!
That was a UFO Kathy dear!
yeah..... and I saw Elvis dancing with elves and Santa Clause, and there were unicorns too...
LOVE the fake boat with grey figurines.... REALLY helped me understand the story better.
To be followed by book release next week
either at the bottom of an ocean or thru a worm hole
i wonder what she was on that she thought she was hallucinating?
Why did she wait so long to say something?
"She thought she was hallucinating..." Um, hello???? Do drugs, much? Otherwise, why would she think "she was hallucinating", unless she actually does do drugs? I don't know if she does drugs or not, but something is definitely NOT right about this...good grief...nothing like a "delayed reaction" about this plane...the world is searching for this plane, and she "suddenly" has a brain fart? Seriously?
You mean like how people see UFO's but are constantly told, 'you were just hallucinating'. These people then suffer all sorts of ridicule- just as you are doing right now... no wonder people do not come forward after seeing unusual things.
If she was/had been drinking Absinth or Jagermeister, it is possible she was hallucinating, as both have ingredients that can cause hallucinations.
Seriously, bwt...you are comparing a "UFO sighting" to the missing plane everyone around the globe is looking for...really? Wow...
Maybe she really saw Amelia Earhart????
Yes she saw the plane and it was right next to Big Foot, Nessie and the Tooth Fairy
Did she also see Bigfoot arguing with a Yeti in Nepal about eminent domain..........?
People will say anything to get 15min of fame
There was a yeti in my backyard last night. I couldn't believe my eyes because it's been months since we've had snow. And they like snow. Should I call the authorities?
WOW! What have you been SMOKING ..SEA WEED?
wow...way to let it play out lady...you should feel terrible. While you wouldnt have saved any lives, you could have saved a lot of time and actually helped.
personally I think the woman is a nut case...
Good Job Giligan, what did the skipper say about what you saw?
I saw the plane too. Elvis was the pilot.
"Two planes above it tailing it"? Sounds like fighter escorts that could have possibly shot it down. At this point, who knows?
Sailing with no Sails, Hmmmm. Looks like Cruising to me.
Her "I want to be famous" story.
She either has proof or she is grasping at her fifteen minutes of fame. Either way... with no proof... she has no truthful story!
Unemployed airline expert are waiting in line for interviews and theories again…..
Yuuuuuuuuuup. And I saw Bigfoot last week too! Guess I'd better alert somebody...
Be sure to read every line before signing with fox.
I saw Bigfoot too! He gave me the peace sign from his motorcyle!
And how EXACTLY does she know it was MH370?
Uh huh. And I saw Santa Clause while waterskiing.
OK. You claim to have seen a plane on fire crash into the ocean. Why did you NOT sail your boat towards the crash and confirm? no common sense these days.............
I question how well she could see with a straightjacket on.
Well here's another story Wolf Blitzer and those navigation guys will have theories on....
Oh course she did!!! Hey I saw it too, it flew into the Bermuda triangle!!!
maybe that was the black hole opening up that Don Lemon talked about........... geez
dear mrs tee, your 15 minutes is up. please exit life immediately.
all her husband saw was her face and the floor of the sail boat.
of course, she never bothered to investigate...like might be some survivors you know...
its going to take the amount of time it took them to find TITANIC to find this plane smh. My grandchildren will study this in history class.
Hot Damn, CNN can restart 24hr coverage of this to keep Obamas #$%$-ups off the news
Anyone who has blue water sailed, at night, you think your eyes play tricks.....I do not discount this woman , as a matter of fact, it gives more proof to the "batteries" being shipped and causing the crash (fire and no oxygen in the plane)....remember China was (legally, illegally) shipping large batteries on this flight and they were highly combustible
had a dream about it last nite they landed on a remote pacific island are partying with the natives getting high having sex and none of them want to return to reality
She didn't say anything cuz she was doing 'shrooms at the time.
big diff between a P3 and 777
Months have gone by, and now she comes forward...right.
Does anyone else want to smack the snot out of her..
It's obvious she had did some type of drugs. If I see a plane on fire (even though I have never seen that before) I'm not going to question what I was seeing. I could be drunk out of my mind and still know a burning plane when I see one.
All planes should have "hive connections" and free wi-fi transmitters on them. Now you can track all planes at any time and also get free wi-fi all over the world! win win... well, except for the greedy fckrs in this world. They would rather nickle and dime us with sub-par internet speeds.
The lady is SO full of it.
#$%$....what was she drinking! She didnt think to report this when it was on the news 24/7, crazy or drunk ? idk
The woman sounds like an idiotic lunatic. In other words, she didn't see anything. Not a peep from her husband either who was there with her on that little boat. "...she did noit believe her eyes..." "...She thought she was hallucinating..." "...never seen a plane with orange lights before so I wondered what they were..." "...Since that’s not something you see every day, I questioned my mind..." "...what appeared to be an elongated plane..." "...But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane...” "... if it was a plane on fire that I was seeing, the other aircraft would report it...” "... but I chose to sweep it under the carpet and now I feel really bad..."
I don't believe the plane went into the Sea. Its in enemy hands. Why would the pilot make a 360 turn? And why were 3 passengers having to not be on the plane, but THEIR luggage NOT removed. They have to deboard but their cargo wasn't taken off the plane? This entire issue doesn't make sense. Always, another scandal after another///////////////
That luggage story has been debunked a hundred times by now, you just won't believe anything that goes against your "theory".
I still say this plane is on land and is hidden.
I bet the pilots in the other two planes she saw around it feel badly now too that they did not report it.
So if she is/was not insane there is a conspiracy afoot.
Shot down, wreckage retrieved. Cover-up complete
well she got her name in print
I can see, by these comments, why the lady would be reluctant to tell her story. But, what of the other two planes, that she said she saw above the burning flight? Could be the missing plane.
This disappearance of MH370 will remain a mystery pretty much like who really killed JFK
by looking into a mirror, I assume ?
Nah, it was the UFO that captured the plane.
just goes to show how many stupid rich people there are out there
Sailing? um, someone needs a little education - the image is not a SAILBOAT it is a POWER BOAT. You sail a sail boat, you MOTOR a powerboat. The story seems to be a day late and a dollar short. Why wait until now? LOOSER!
Please lady tell that to your husband you can't fool me.
I suppose she heard a ping too.
Must have been some good drugs.
Why do they say sailing when they clearly have a picture of a power boat? And she sailed something like 2000 miles in a cigarette boat? Someone's slip is showing.
Courtney Love does see things ya know. :)
That plane will show up in the near future with one or all of the five Taliban that were traded for Bergdahl
She prob. got under, got bonged by a s)h)l)o)n)g in the forehead and thought it was an airplane.
It was bound to happen sooner or later anything for attention .
more than likely it's Obama's fault.
Sounds like they were on their way back to Thailand for a bit more Thai Stick to me.
I'm pretty sure I saw it flying over Atlanta but I was in Phoenix when it happened....
She saw it and her husband didn't?
Is she saw it, Stevie Wonder saw it too
SHE JUST WOKE FROM SLEEP, IDIOT ,WANT POPULARITY
and I saw Santa on Christmas eve. watching to much T V!
and she is just now coming around ???? where did dthis happened. ? where was she qwhen she said she saw this. why after all this time is she coming forward. something fishy about this.
Of course she did. She just thinks to tell it now? What a publicity stunt!
Doing shrooms while sailing from India to Thailand can sure be fun!
Shemp has more brains than this fool. Her husband must be a winner too.
Yeah right! I saw it too, I was scuba diving and I saw it pass right under me.
So, who was on board that some country wanted gone?
The missing Malaysian flight flies over my house EVERY day!.......And the pilot even waves to me!.....First I called the police.....then the FAA....then the Malaysian government.....but no one will listen to me.
So HOW do you "Sail" a POWERBOAT !?!?
I saw a UFO with a tractor beam trying to lift me off my back porch the other night...of course I had a few too many glasses of red wine, so I'm not 100% if this story holds water.
She got her 15 mins of fame.
I saw Kurt Cobain 2 years ago in Hawaii! He looked pretty good too! Oh wait that was Elvis Presley!
Yeah she sounds real creditable....Hallucinating, really?
As before just ask China what they did to it.
She waited this long to report it? I'll bet she did it. Find Sherlock Holmes, make her talk.
Oh really, she comes forward now, after over two months of it missing. Dahhhh, have another hit lady, you'll see it agian better this time.......
I'm sorry but.....I don't believe a word of it. Three months go by without a word from her? Hallucinating or not, you should have reported it because it's better to be safe than sorry. Once again....she is full of Buffalo cookies!!
Is this even a real boat in the picture???
Yes, yes, great, terrific, but................how does this advance the Gay Agenda? Is the witness bi-curious, or at least transgendered? If not, then it leaves us right back where we started.
well now CNN has another source to talk to for weeks on end..........
I don't believe her; she is just looking for fame
Didn't Jenny McCarthy have some delightful idea as to where it's at too?
Oh yeah...I just ran into JIMMY HOFFA and ELVIS! I should have said something earlier.....
In the news Kat Tee found dead, she committed suicide by hanging and a suicide note says depression was the factor, The CIA had nothing to do with the murde..... Suicide they claimed....
so what does this mean...how long did she see it, what happened... i think sailors are in constant need of money, and therefor this idea came up now.....the whole story needs some exact verification....
Stupid C just wants to be part of the story. Liar.
Question if not asked, where the hell have you been lady?!?
Why did she wait until now to say something?
This woman clearly has a degree in bologna
shrooms do not help. or was it LSD?
And what does Tee's husband say about all this?
"Yes, dear! Anything you wish, dear!" He's probably her personal doormat.
Call CNN!!!! 10 weeks of interviews with her!!!
she "thought she was going insane or maybe hallucinating"??? Either you are or not. If you are not sure---you are on drugs. She saw 2 planes above the plane on fire going the other way???? Really? Then it was shot down. and meant to not be found.
she questioned her sanity? really..I question her sanity as well you either see something or you don't.
Are you kidding me? This is an insane article and was she with her husband? did he see this?
Ya I seen it too. I was out in my yard picking mushrooms and eating them. About 45 minutes later their it was flying overhead with what appeared to be rainbows coming out of where the engines should be.
Me too, but the rainbows were going the other way from Uranus.
I predicted the bombing of Pearl Harbor...on December 8, 1941.
YAH YAH YAH another mouth piece heard from, you've had your 15 minutes of "OH, I SAW" go back to your drinking. Two months after it happened? B.S.
Take a Big Puff on Willie's Cigar you Drunken sailor!
yeah and I saw a pumpking pie in the sky.
so if this story is true, then they should be able to pin point the area and find the plane ALREADY ??????????
Another F'ing Can Of Worms! This halucinating C should have kept Suking until her wet dream exploded in her mouth!
think someone was in the sauce a little that night! like would you not try to radio someone ??
Lets face it - - some people just aren't all that smart.
Sure! I saw it too... Just took me months to remember! I saw it when I was in California at the beach! Hurry come here my story news people.. I want my 10 mins too!
Tee, your 15 mins came and went. Missed it by this much!!!!
unvelieved you waited this long to tell that you are a very bad person
Oh God.....another 2 months of CNN nonsense.
I would like whatever she was smoking
Yeah and I saw Elvis while on board the Mothership!
Ahhh, yea, I a, saw it too. It was a, flying right over me and it had a banner on it that said ''eat at Joe's.'' Yea. That's the ticket.
She better stay on the dock for now on! What a loon!
I cannot believe they are still searching for that plane. Obviously, they don't know what they are doing. They should call in the U.S. Navy Seals. They probably could find it. People dead, and missing? This plane has to be found. How do you know they are not being held somewhere?
why is her husband so quite?
He was probably asleep! She said she was on "night watch".
Would you want to be alive if she's your wife , Commenter ??
15 minutes of spotlight starting . . . now!
b4 I read any comments..I will say...I don't believe this women...plus for her to say she may be going insane...is dumb...Maybe her husband is always telling her she's crazy. Sweeping under the rugs? Pleezeee. Now I'll read the comments.
I felt the same way. Main reason why, where was her husband? If I had seen something like that, first thing I would do is tell my husband to come and look.
Brenda you're sooooo very right...I see something like that, this...i would yell, scream..honey baby you come look at this...wait all that time? Really...she wanted her 5 minute fame? huh? what...let me go and get my ice tea drink and see if I could see a comet...
if I was her, I would steer close to the place where plane went down and see if I can help someone
Wading in the BS as we read this one!!
Lady your 15 minutes of fame are over
Wow, I saw it too! I was out on the Indian Ocean smuggling drugs...er..umm..maybe I was halucinating.
wheres tatoo when you need him?
If she was "sailing" in the Indian Ocean, why has Yahoo put up a picture of a power boat?
What will be funny is when they DO find the plane and it's thousands of miles away where she could have never had seen it and she is revealed to be a liar.
would makes since if it was on fire, something went wrong but no plane wreckage is baffling .
You shills are out in force on this one. Have you no shame. You people probably believe that certain INTEL agencies have no idea where, what, how, and when....what a joke.
I wasn't sure if it was a plane on fire or if it was Santa's Sleigh with a sprinkling of fairy dust.
Lady wants her 15 minutes of fame and fortune to pay for her boat.
Yea, and I saw Elvis late last night on his way to the restroom in the pub last night!!
Good witness. Did she see the UFO's just a way off in the sky ?
I CALL BULSHIT !....Months later all these eye witness reports are surfacing .....#$%$ !
So the other planes that she saw never made it on the radar either? ha!
One day everybody involve in dat plane will return bak home. For u woman, watch ya mouth cuz ur bringin bak d pain d world felt. Is it dt u dnt hav radio or tv set, didn't u hear about d missin plane, didn't u hear d world discusin about it. Ok, tell me. Hav u nt heard of d missin Nigerians girls? Ma be careful. Even pple in d local villages heard about d missin plane, or where u in d indian ocean till now ur givin us fake news. If really u saw d plane, ur behind Evertin day happened to d jet..
The headline must be wrong. she could not have been "sailing" in the Indian Ocean because that is not a sailboat. It is a mortor-powqered yacht.
what kind of tea was miss tee ingesting? I saw sasquatch yesterday and wanted to say something but I thought I was going crazy.
I hope Miss Tee won't die next week
She was awake & sailing at about 2:00am in the morning in the Indian ocean when she spotted the plane.........Is this a normal scenario??
She must have good reason to think she was going insane.
I'm sure she also saw big foot and the loch ness monster and maybe a UFO.
Wow! I once saw the Smurf Village.
Um. No. No you didn't see that... Thanks though...
This is such a non story now. We are going on four months and nothing has been found. Creepy stuff.
the fact that she waited this long makes me believe she is telling the truth. 1. if she tried to tell someone right away, chances are she would have been brushed off. 2. The way she explains how the plane went down would explain some things, but not all. 3. I always suspected foul play. the extra lights in the sky may confirm it. 4. she wouldn't wait this long to get attention
I saw Elvis the other day at the donut shop...
She saw Elvis that day, too!
The plane I think went down at night travelling to the Indian Ocean, Timeline will positively confirm if this is the Malaysian plane.
why wait so long even if you couldn't believe your eyes?
pings and handshakes, that's all they have to go by. sooner or later the Thai's will admit they shot it down for crossing their air-space, it's a cover-up for sure!
"She did not believe her eyes at the time?" At the time it was just an aircraft in the sky, and she couldn't believe her eyes??? WoW! I think this woman had too much sun. I seen a blue creature yelling out Gargamal once. Where's my 15 minutes of fame?
See something you are not used to seeing, logical conclusion, I am insane. ya.....
Not impossible....afterall- I swear I saw Amelia Earhart in a moat by my house. But no one believes me:(
Hmmm...something going down fast in flames? It might have been Obama's approval rating.
"Early March", and it is now June 4th when reported.... R i g h t. Nothing here folks, let's all move along.
If she said corrected,why another plane's pilots had not reported for plane with fire over indian ocean?
Is this the lady who states she also dated Jimmy Hoffa...after he went missing?
why waste anymore millions looking for a bunch of dead people. have a wake & get over it..
"I'd like some attention so I made up some stuff so the media would mention me!"
Something sounds a bit fishy with this... I think that Mrs.Tee might not be telling the truth but in fact just wanted to see her name in the news. Sad what some people will do in order to get attention...
................. "I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Yeah, let's go with that.
This is what we are reduced to?
as she said she is out of her mind enuff said
She should leave the pot at home on her next trip.
Couldn't believe her own eyes ? I call B/S . So how many other things have you seen and didnt report because you thought your eyes were lying to you lady ? B/S !
Also saw Elvis close by on a surf board
How can you see black smoke at night ?
If it's a clear night, it would still stand out and be visible.
I think the only smoke this lady saw was the smoke coming from her hash pipe.
This "account" is completely made up...plane landed on Diego garcia
The story that will never end.
So now the flight is the Lochness monster.
Well, that must have been the longest hangover she's ever had. Good Grief, how flippin stupid! I can't believe this.
in March? The plane disappeared much later than March....W*T*F?!!
must be some powerful herb she is smoking.
Did anyone brought to her attention, that mixing barbiturates can cause hallucinations...and it's not recommended while sailing...another word... tripping b*a*l*I*s at it's peak....;))) When i want entertainment, i go to yahoo "articles" ...why spend money going to movie theaters...!!!
I thing they were asmoken some BAD Fugu! Akshuly I see this to when I light my bowl...
Dammit, I was still wishing the CNN story about the black hole was still in the running!
I saw the plane the other day, however it was still flying. It was big, had wings and was loud,I saw other planes also,I think they were the babies of the big one. I sent my story to CNN,they are going to make a mini series out of it and i will be rich.
LOL. What a crock of a story.
She had just made up with her husband after a long disagreement, and while making love she saw the burning plane!!
Let's blame Russia again since everyhting is blamed on Russia these days!
Why are so many people giving negative comments? Do any of you have proof she is mentally ill or seeking attention from the meda? As they say iron clad proof?
I agree that we should pay attention to this lady.
What a misleading headline. She isn't claiming she saw the missing plane, she's saying that she saw something that she now believes may have been the plane. That's it.
I heard it was George Bush's fault.
Katherine thought she was hallucinating (again?) and didn't report it
They don't want to hear from her because that would make them all look like fools. There were islanders who spotted the plane and they were ignored. There is more to the story than we know or will know.
It's not sailing if you're in a motor boat.
Two planes above it and those pilots and crews didn't observe it and report it. I want to know what Tee was smoking, or drinking the night she witnessed that. I'm guessing it wasn't tea. And why wait until now to report it. X-Files baby....X-Files!
Burning plane in the sky not worth taking a picture of? Sounds legit. . .
Did she see this ship before or after she saw Elvis and Tupac?
Wasn't this the same lady that said she saw Elvis?
if only herve villachez was still alive, he could help
takes 3 months to make sure you saw something correctly. :/
This is one of the looniest missing plane stories to top all of the other loony stories since day one when those who could solve it chose to not solve it.
All this time and she says nothing??????? Any normal person would report anything suspicious that they saw just to help out and let the searchers determine what it was.
If you are saying they were sailing at least put a sail boat in the picture.
....and Elvis was at the controls...
Why has there been "NO" debris found ???? If the plane hit the water, there would be debris all over the place. I say the plane is intact being hid for a dangerous mission.
Hadnt thought of that. Now, 5 Taliban terrorists have been released and the soldier brought home. traded. and this move was in the making for a few months. sounds logical to me...hope not
Go on you tube this thing is all "settled ", she is just having her five minutes of fame !
I saw the plane land at O'Hare. Get the press ready.
The Things People do to get their 15 Minutes of Fame !!
So many "nay sayers." We have no way of proving her story true or false, yet the majority of those posting want to instantly respond in the most negative of ways.
I'd be checking out her bank account right about now.
She was smoking the funny on the high seas.
Martians got it. Beam me up Scottie
if someone saw a plane on fire in the middle of the ocean im pretty damn sure they would of reported it....
I SAW IT TOO. FLYING OVER MY HOUSE IN CT
I smell a rat.cause I was floating by her sail on a homemade raft ,and I saw the same thing.hummI didnt know it was 370 though.
don't have cellphone ? no pic is hoax delirious from the heat?
i have a terrible in my stomach sickening feeling that the pilot and co-pilot became incapacitated, there was no way to get in to the cockpit so all the passengers sat waiting for the jet to run out of fuel and crash....horrible
Where's her husband? What did he see? This is a weird story. She said alot of things to me that don't make sense. You either saw something or you didn't and you draw a conclusion of being insane. Odd, just odd.
She wasn't sure if it was a shooting star or a jet. A shooting star takes a second to travel across the sky while a jet would take at least 15 minutes.
WE NOW HAVE TO FIND OUT WHICH GOVERNMENT HAD IT SHOT DOWN. YES, I BELIEVE HER STORY. NOW LET US PROVE IT.
This sounds very sketchy at best, but who knows maybe its the truth
I witnessed the JFK assassination. saw a CIA gent on the grassy knoll but figured there were plenty of other people who would report it. can I have my 5 min of fame now?
2 other planes...so they were probably shot down...if she had called in an sos...she would probably be dead...conspiracies are afoot in all directions.
Why this woman suddenly speak out today ?? after a few months ? Are she looking at $$$$$$
"I saw a burning plane in the sky and presumed that I had gone insane"...?...RRRRreallllleee?
I bet she see's the Easter Bunny on Easter too.
Why now? Whats so unusual that made her think shes going insane? Be it a plane on fire or a meteor. Its not as if she saw a flying whale or a mermaid. She also had someone with her at that time. I find her claim skeptical at best.
I was camped out in Roswell, NM on June 22nd when a strange looking being asked me how to get to the Bus Station. I wish hadn't taken those Peyote Buttons.
Reading this article and the way this woman spoke for the press made me feel like I am reading some kind of fiction book! Seriously, what the heck was she thining??!!
That's NOT a sailboat in the picture! Bahahaha
There were many reports of others seeing this same thing--all were dismissed by so called authorities. These reports were made right away. Lets face it ..everything that should have the answers to the missing plane..has been a joke. And this woman coming forward now..shes a joke too.
I'm more interested in who "wrote" this post and who "edited" it. Seems like a suspicious claim in itself.
Lady u take the cake on being dumb!
What the hell is she smoking? I need some of it...
You don't want whatever she is on.
if this is true what hi profile person or thing was on that plane
Isn't this the same woman who claimed she saw Elvis at a Burmese nightclub wearing just a hula skirt? . . . ." I Couldn't believe my eyes! ! ! ! "
""She thought she was hallucinating, I questioned my mind"" Thanks, thats all the info we need from you..............................
I saw Santa Claus come down the chimmey last night to and he'd been drinking
I once saw Bigfoot, turns out I was just high....no more drugs for me....until tomorrow
she felt she saw other planes, that is her credibility. she felt they would help it.
If this lady ever excepts too make it big in poltics she will need to go to law school and learn to tell a better lie that this.
***yawn, yea right. and the 3d replay looks like propaganda. if what she says is true, then 2 other planes know exactly what happened.
Wonder how much money she will get for telling her story for xxx amount of years before anybody can prove her wrong if they even can ?
Aaahhhh, Ya right. Sound like someone is trying to put this story to bed. you see what may be a plane on fire, you not sure and you question yourself, plausible. you get back to shore and after 24, 48 or even 72 hours and you do not come forward, not a chance in hell.
..she sighted Elvis and Jim Morrison too.
I think i saw the plane also. First i thought it was a bird, then a plane. Then i thought i need my eyes checked if i can make that kind of mistake.
no wonder your coming from ,India, another hell
This plane was shot down. Now we have to find out who did it.
I also saw green men the other flying in the sky
I don't know a more credible source than that..
This would be a better story if she said she saw it while crossing the Indian Ocean in her ultra light
Sounds like material for the"National Enquirer "
I saw it last night as well, after a few shrooms and a joint
... but it was very far from the search area ! How could an airplane on fire flew all this distance before crashing into the ocean ?
Where has she been for the last two months, Mars?
north korea did it some say...
She had to make sure her tinfoil hat was still secured to her head, then she was sure she saw a plane!
That picture is not one of a sailboat.
So she had to believe her eyes after three months?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even the other fisherman, now he said he say it?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Something is not ticking right in my opinion. Three months are not three days OMG!!!
They got some good chit in Thailand, man.
what was she smoking back then?
I think I saw it, ummmmm, maybe. Yes, yes it was a jet or a flying saucer.
Well lady. Where did it crash?
Ok Obama haters, let it rip.
Why take all this time to say anything ?
what she saw may have been the Russian rocket that exploded around that time
I hope they find the plane soon so the movie can come out.
Good rendering of a sailboat. *facepalm*
I saw it too. I was in Bequia, this chick was soooo f'ed up.
This lady is all wrong…. I saw the plane that same night flying over the Caribbean Sea….. This gall is full of it….
It's a meteor, it's a plane, no it's super drugs.
Yeah Right, was Elvis the pilot?
I think it's more likely she was going insane. She sounds looney.
Yep, she was right, she was insane.
a few drinks can make a disaster
What a moron. Let's talk about what we saw 3 months later.
She saw a plane on fire with two planes above it, No SOS, warning, call's for help, or any part's of the plane found. Huh, HOW $%@^%$ stupid is she!
Yea sure lady, and you and Timothy Leary were good friends...LMAO...What a crock of #$%$.
You mean she didn't get any pictures of it on her iphone?
She is looking for big pay day
Everyone wants to get in the act? Look if it was the plane? why they can't find anything? Maybe the two plane she said she saw was space ship from "MARS."
So she waits months before she tells anyone, yeah right lady....next!
DANG! Now my Lassie story wont' fly! Thanks for stealing my thunder. :(
They are going to find Jimmy Hoffa and the Cubs are going to win a World Series first before they find this plane.
I saw Elvis last week in New Orleans but he looked like he was near 80....OH he IS near 80. What she saw was a huge joint being passed from her husband to her and thought THAT was a plane...or maybe not and the woman is just making it up. I saw Santa Claus once....but it was my uncle george drunk late at night under the tree sleeping with cotton on his face and red hat...hey, who knew.
Yeah, well I thought I just saw Elvis sitting on the toilet in a restroom at one of the indian casinos the other night, but I couldn't really believe it so I didn't ask for his autograph.........
I saw the plane too. I really did.Now give me $100,000,000 for my trouble. I mean it was very painful to watch it crash.
My point is that, no other boats sail the same way back? No cruises at all? Why is that day she happen to see what she said she saw?....mmm something fishy here..
I guess she did not get the memo...if you see something say something!!!!!
Probably still tripping from the Banglassi milkshake she drank in India.
She thought it was more likely she was going insane? Huh. That's a weird statement.
its possible..an ecplosion in the plane rendered eveyone unconscious and the plane was leaking fuel on fire..its quite possible
No mention of her husband seeing the plane. Did she not tell him to look?
"She thought she was hallucinating..." That pretty much says it all right there.
sounds like the woman scored some good opium and saw a flying saucer.
all those lithium batteries caught flame
after the news how could you not feel that seen a plane on fire might even be real or that she would wonder it was real
Her story stinks! Why didn't she come forth a long time ago. I don't think she saw squat!!
call the nurse she a fricking nut job! British #$%$.
Wow. This has been on Yahoos headline all day. Need to find another homepage.
Does the world leaders know what happened to this plan or is this woman really hallucenating
They ought to make a movie about a plane that crashed into the deep ocean and the survivors believed they were on an isolated, unknown island, but they were really dead . . .
How DUMB is this woman not come forward right away!! NOT believing a word of this bull #$%$!!!
Too bad this woman got her 15 minutes of fame by being crazy.
whatever can get you in the front page;Man! what has happened to this generation or women for that matter she wants to make money then why don't she be a internet star she probably does not have a good body; what a #$%$ of a world we live anything for a buck!!!!!
SHE WAS AND STILL IS high!
There's noth ing to see here folks, she saw a UFO.
I saw MH370 on San Francisco sky too
Maybe not going insane, just not in her right mind at the time.
And only now coming forward?! Fifteen seconds of fame?
i saw it in Lake Huron.
This should help all the conspiracy people…on to new and better heights..
Tee smoking too much of her own leafy substance .... you have your 5 minutes of fame, now go away.
Wait a minute !! I just remembered I had Dinner with the two pilots the day before and thought to myself they were acting strangely !!
@Robert, yes you are correct. No one has ever discredited the Oil Rig Worker's observations which were quite wxact.
CNN WILL HAVE A FIELD DAY WITH THIS ONE
Sounds like a head case to me.
I think I see a plane! De plane.
someone blody clear a room in the psyc ward.. stat!
yeah and i saw big foot driving a chevrolet after leaving a bar but no one listens when , I couldnt believe my eyes
What does her husband, Marc Horn say about this? He was there.
Incredible...seeing black smoke at night. How amazing.
she spotted what looked like a plane on fire during the night of March 7. “There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,” she said. So she saw jetliner#370 on fired at NIGHT??? She saw other 2 plane fly above #370 at the same time at NIGHT??? are u using night vesion???? Umm.....doesn't sound right at all Sounds pure propaganda for ms tee
but I chose to sweep it under the carpet and now I feel really bad,” she said. ”Maybe I should have had a little more confidence in myself. I am sorry I didn’t take action sooner.” Why sounds propaganda to me?????
Right! Why would she wait until months later? She knew several countries were exhausting all efforts to find this plane! Oh yeah, the headlines are gone. She picked the perfect time to grab herself a headline!
I sure hope CNN doesn't get wind of this story. They'll have her on for WEEKS straight talking about her story.
Lies to cover up more lies.
And I had a brewski with D.B.Cooper last night...sheeesh...
She's looking for her 15 min.
honest people question what doesn't fit into normal reality
" but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time." So she's believing her eyes now?!?!?!?!?!?
The woman should go a doctor and cure her halozinations
We had better luck when Courtney Love said she found it
she should report the accident when she saw it and it wl help a lot of missing families
"she looked up the flight plan of the aircraft and discovered their journeys intersected,"..........I don't think so. The original flight plan was directly North to China and only went South into the Indian Sea because it was diverted that way........so no, she did not discover the flight plan intersected with her location in the Indian Ocean.
to late lady the world moved on to new disasters.
you saw a flaming airplane in the sky and questioned your sanity??!!! if you even thought you saw something like that... if you even questioned your sanity about seeing it you should have done something ...said something! especially after hearing about a missing aircraft you should have come forward! of course unless your lying your #$%$ off!
I saw it get off the BART in Berkeley. I remember thinking there s' that flight from Malaysia so I yelled ,"nobody knows where you are dude," but it just kept on going
Funny that same day I thought I saw the abonimable snowman in my back yard. What a conindence.
Tell me something this woman who saw the plane was it Ginger or Mary Ann?
Katherine have you been nipping again ?
It was shot down by Chinese jets since MH370 went the airspace claimed by China.
I believe her, and in fact it was being chased by a UFO piloted by Bigfoot. I mean, who knew Bigfoot could fly a UFO...?
She's an idiot and you're an idiot if you believe this nutcase
Now who first is going sign her?
i saw it too damn con #$%$
Well if I were sailing in a large body of water like the Indian O' that would be a little suspicious ? But that's way the world is screwed up everyone seem's to be on auto pilot, and no one does anything about anything, She could have saved the Goverment's that were involved a whole lot of money !!!!!!!!!!!!!
May be there is a truth that it passes across Malaysian air space and was fired by Malaysian air force before it went down
You remember March 18 news "Fishermen from this village believe they may have seen the missing Malaysia Airlines flight on the night it disappeared flying low over the Gulf of Thailand"?
now... if you were doing something illegal or perhaps carrying something illegal on the open waters etc..... would YOU call the authorities right away? Think about it, the lady thought she was hallucinating...? what do you THINK she had on board? Ginseng tea???? NOT
nevertheless, she also saw thick black smoke trailing the burning plane...in the middle of the night...She must be smoking something real good to come up with this bs story...
regardless they are all crab food now
Im sure the ACID i took didn't have anything to do with what i saw....
Yeah, right, if you believe this "fairy tail" then I have a bridge in London to sell you if you have the cash to pay for it !
So was her husband insane also?
Complete, utter bulls..t , typical hard-hitting Yahoo reporting.
liar as a captain of a boat you have a legal obligation to assit any in distress on the ocean you have to take pass a coast guard test in america
BS as in #$%$ Perhaps she was just paid of to tell this story...............who ya' gonna call? Ghostbusters?! Who ya' gonna' trust.......Hmmmmm....
I saw it to while fishing at Lake Texoma !
About the plane, total bull*^%" ! the US Gov. knows "exactly" where it is and where the patent holders are being held (over $100 billion) in patents were on that plane
sounds like a bunch of #$%$ to me
Woman seeking notoriety claims She Saw Missing Malaysian Air Flight While Sailing In Indian Ocean
Sounds like Battery got burn in the cargo..
General Tso Chicken, she too hot!
who in the hell would be sailing out in the indian ocean? Don't they have a radio on their boat?
Is this the same woman that saw Big Foot and the Lock Ness Monster?
She should tell CNN and then the mystery is solved
Weed sure does make you see things...
Did she just wake up from that 3 month nap?
she probably saw the glow from the end of her joint when she turned real fast
what type of crack did she smoke , must be a very bad stuff
sad. that wasn't even 15 minutes of fame for her.
this woman is Planted! cant seriously believe this account! after this much time has passed,after the media bliss that took place - I have said from the beginning they will ""find"" this plane when its the right time!
Yeah and so did Hillary when she had her stroke
So she thought that two planes headed the other way would report it? Not if they were the ones that shot it in the first place. Mankind is doomed if we don't revert our slide into idiocy. Starting to look like the Planet of the Apes may not be as farfetched as we would think.
How about a picture or the video?
This is getting to be like a spy novel with all the twists & turns, lies, mistruths and out and out media nonsense to complete the trifecta.
We were have a late night surf, yeah that was it . . . and it was dark yeah . . . and I saw a plane . . yeah a big one . . . and it was flying inverted (wheels up) and the pilot was hanging out of the window yelling he was being killed by a CIA agent . . yeah that was it a CIA agent . . .
"she spotted what looked like a plane on fire during the night of March 7"... then she said : " there was what appeared to be black smoke behind it " .... really ? She saw a black smoke in the night sky ? Good try !
she was sailing....yeah...more like taking a Magic Carpet Ride...
Good Lord God! Un-Believable…."I am sorry I didn’t take action sooner.”…So many other's waiting for any kind of news (if this be true) are sorry you did nothing, and said nothing!
Where was she when she saw it? India to Thailand does not help. Who wrote this drivel?
I would like to know where she saw the plane...it might help.
I saw it too, but didn't think to report it.
“There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,” she said. “They had normal navigation lights." - then why didn't the other planes report this? She doesn't pass the smell test.
Whew! This gives CNN something to "report" on for another six months! Saved by the lunatic.
She didn't say nothing because they were hauling hashish!
And, of course, after seeing such a spectacle, she doesn't think to get a direction of flight; The time: Her direction of travel and....HER POSITION??????? One of those people in the #$%$ boat HAD to be pretty much, an expert Navigator???? yet the Cement Heads stood there with their mouths open and their thumbs up their.................... and did nothing but.................WAIT.....to say anything a MONTH LATE......
Hmmm BS. still doesnt find it. Im sorry its lost Im sorry for the families but its time to over on. I hope their families find peace.
Why is she saying something now instead of when it happened?
UFO or military cover-up? The TRUTH...is out there! Dun-dun-DUNNNNNN!!!!
Was the plane shot down by fighter aircraft of some yet to be determined country???
Another #$%$ story too keep are eyes on something else..
Sheesh......I would have reported it. being on the ocean can do strange things to ones mind but....It almost sounds as if you were in trouble too and did not have your wits...
So, china shot it dowm, hmmmmm???????? Sounds about right. Everybody avoiding the TRUTH! Yep. Par for the political course.
She IS insane, who sees a plane on fire and thinks they are going crazy? This lady either crazy or stupid....
How many people have reported something they cant explain in the sky only to be ridiculed....
Don't they watch news? It's until now they realized what they saw after three months! Come on...
This old soomka was probably delirious.
she said there were TWO OTHER PLANES FLYING ABOVE IT!!! she thought that the other planes would be able to see it. if it was the malaysian plane, conspiracies will continue to abound. theres been some interesting ones
#$%$! Took to long for them to get there story straight. She would of came forward immediately. The governments did something with this plane. So much lies being told. We don't believe you anymore."
Smoken Some Good Stuff Seen real #$%$ too, Was it a UFO
Yea Lady it looks like you just woke from mid summer night dream while vacationing in "Alice in wonder" land.
She's British. She was drunk out of her mind. They're all like that.
THEN WHY HASNT SHE SAID ANYTHING BEFORE!."??? ?????????
Sounds like Republicans seeing holograms of Nixon.....Wackos.
Nah, sounds more like Democrats burning flags and killing babies.....degenerates.
And did she happen to note the GPS coordinates?
Ha. I call BS. Even her quote sounds more like, " Can I get some attention please?'"
Yeah, and I saw Elvis playing miniature golf in Branson.
and she waits 3 months to say something??? How stupid, no one is going to believe her now.
#$%$? "She thought she was hallucinating"???? How often does this happen to you? THis woman is a whack job who shouldn't even be listened to.
I wonder what she has been paid for her " information "?? I smell a buck being made here at the at the expense of the families.........just saying!
first off if it turns out to be it this couple needs to be b@tch slap. and no photos??
Fishy...real fishy. Wait three months to spew that insightful drivel? Not buying it.
this woman is the break the case needed
I never believe these stories when the person takes eons to report it. "Yeah, I saw Jimmy Hoffa on the day he disappeared, but I'm just telling you now..." Sure.
Not from that boat she didn't.
Wrong search area.Plane crashed on land.
i think they need to look up obama'sASS!
Later she revealed all the pictures of the plane will be released for $5 Million dollars.
Any crackpot who claims to have seen something can be somebody on the internet
Yeah, right. After all this time. Sounds like an attention W *H O *R E to me.
impossible because flight 370 never existed
CNN will be crash central again.
If she saw it, then it isn't missing.
Tee's 15 minutes of fame for no information what so ever......
Hey, I saw it, now can I get my 15 minutes of fame too?
I saw BIG FOOT in 1967, the LOCHNESS MONSTER in 1972 and Dan Quayle's brain in 1994, but I am only now coming forward because I did not believe my eyes at the time.
the new search area is now 67768 000000 square miles...quick, let see if we can locate the oil slick...
I saw Elvis in Vegas last month, having a beer with Osama Bin Laden and Sadam Hussein.
She thought she was hallucinating?!?!?!? #$%$
she didn't see anything. she just wants her 15 minutes of fame. if she really did see a plane on fire, she would have notified her hubby or fellow sailors, etc. what a stupid lying woman.
swamp gas trapped in a weather balloon reflected light off of Venus
Somebody needs her 5 min. of "fame".
She didn't believe her eyes then, why believe them now!!!!
Did anybody check to see if there was any weed on her boat ?
hmmm, a sailing boat without a mast. Okay, I'm some dumb bloke that will buy this story 90% of viewers fit into this category). Then she thinks she was hallucinating (she doesn't trust her own eyes). but it must be true.
"But I thought that the it was more likely that I was going insane." What?
must have been obscured by their sails. that boat looks like it can really sail.
WOW, is the crack just now wearing off? May have been that dam Chinesse aircraft carrier? Wo, give me one more ICE COLD India Rhye PALE Ale
....the Malay Air Force put a rocket into it to keep it from the Petronas Towers - 'The WTC of the east' - then covered it up for fear of an angry Chinese response.
I've always assumed that the Malays would surely notice a huge plane turning around and would assume the possibility of an attack scenario ..?
not on that pee bucket they didn't
I saw Amelia Earhart's plane but thought nothing of it!!
Katheryn Tee: Doobie doobie doobie....hmmmm...looks like plane....I can't believe my eyes...doobie doobie....I must be hallucinating again....gotta lay off that crack once and for all. Marc...pass me that crack pipe again.
How do you sail from these two points in that boat in the pic
Why am I here? Nothing good can come out of reading this article or perusing these comments. Only drivel and madness live here. I become less human every trip down this hole. Help.
Tell your story to CNN since that's the only news they no how to cover
How deep is this water she was sailing inn.
Doesn't make sense that she wouldn't have said something sooner.
She never said where the plane went down. Through out her sailing time, that alleged fireball was in the air? Is that even Possible?
That is what she said. What did her husband say?
He said pass me the Bong #$%$ quit bogartin the #$%$
WOW , REALLY??? DID YOU SEE SOME ufo's, TOO???
Too much of that wacky weed
It took her 3 months to come forward with this, comes to terms with what she claimed she saw? I strongly suspect someone is looking for her 15 of fame.
And I saw little green men in my backyard last night.
this plane could have been shot down .just saying or the batteries onboard had a problem, hijacked? hope they find out!!
Sail back home....You looking for attention....BOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Perhaps looking for her 15 minutes?
see saw-----oh and i thught i was insane-------(drunk off your #$%$)
do ya'll think she will buy this 100 stories 5 star hotel underneath the ocean
Wait a minute, it looked liked a plane on fire during the (night) of March 7. With a trail of (black) smoke behind it thousands of feet high. Yeah ok
I also saw big foot on Tuesday.
She thought she was hallucinating? She questioned her mind? She thought it was more likely that she was going insane? Maybe she should have had a little more confidence in herself? No I don't think so lady.....You may have saw something, but it is obvious you are crazy as a loon.....
Sounds to me she was hallucinating from drinking to much sea water?????????????????????????????????????
I think that animation is cool...anyone know what software they use to make that?
And no mention of the which country the military planes beloged to?...
I will wait for her book to come and see what the fuss is about. Lol
Three months later and she recalls, it's a hoax.
This looks like a chance to make some money on the talk shows.
attention w(h)ore, we have seen like 20 people that "claim" to see it
wonder where they found this nut case....maybe ole jerry found her for the media...why even print this kind of rediculious #$%$ anywhays
I saw it too and waved but they didn't wave back.
.......and so they continued on their merry way, not even thinking to turn towards the scene of the fiery crash........The End.
and I was the shooter at the Grassy Knoll….
I think a UFO took it with them
Woman sailing...she probably didn't know what direction she was sailing in, or was too busy on her phone texting.
I saw that plane it flew over my house in the states flying low with an orange disc above it with a big beam of light going toward the plane. As they slowed I could see figures of humanoids looking out windows on the orange disc. The ground was shaking and dogs were barking, then poof it was gone.
Going insane? Theres a real genius at work..
Can this story get any more crazy?
I saw it while sitting in my hot tub, flying over the palm trees.
Your eyes play tricks on you when you are on the oceans.
When you drink a lot....you see all sorts of things that may or may not be there.
What a load of bull, 3 months later she thinks she had a dream of maybe selling a book
Do she thinks that she could become famous with her story.
amazing huge jet 230 people after 911 is missing with 2014 techology thats impossible
She waited this long to report it? What a #$%$.
nice story -for a hoax--2 other planes above it--and on fire at night glowing bright orange-- that means -2 pilots had to miss it -and maybe some planes have radar that would tell them something was there-and no airline or air force has claimed to have flights in that area- lady -your story leaks like a 5 pound sack filled with 10 pounds of poop
There is a very rare phenomenon, and it happened on Payne Stewart's flight. Read about his crash, this sounds so much the same. They were flying in there dead for hours until the plane ran out of fuel.
This plane was planned not to be found, these people should get federal protection, or the culprits might harm them, the information they are bringing is not suppose to be at hand. reminds me of the movie " Pain and gain"
and that she knows president's birth certificate is forged....
How many more nut are coming out of the word work with their stories of " I've seen it"
15 seconds of fame for this gal.
This just in - They still haven't found the plane.
Should we believe this account? I'm not sure.
only an imbecile would believe this story
Did not believe her eyes? What a twit!
Come on.....did you really see something or do you just want some attention?...woof!
After I took a hit from the bong I started to imagine I was walking on water to the light then I sparked up a joint and swam with mermaids
Yada, Yada, Yada... 15 minutes of fame & all that rubbish.
So she's saying it was shot down. That would be a mess. So sad.
More likely the plane caught fire due to electrical failure of some sort. Smoke could have asphyxiated the captain and crew, autopilot would have carried them until it failed and led everyone to their resting places. This has actually been a leading theory in what has been a heartbreaking event.
I am banking on it was shot down , lets see if it ever comes out
if any believe this story than I can tell you that I will be the next president of the USA,,
Did she happen to see Elvis as well?
We said before, this was down by a drone and military jets made sure it was done....who is to blame...just at the history of official searches, they all were searching in the wrong spots to avoid blame.
Someone looking for their 15 minutes of fame.
It's been spotted at least 100 times by now
That is what i always thought. It had been shot down and the truth had to be hidden.
Maybe this coming forward is another lie hiding the truth. The events are true but not the sailing. or she came forward but much earlier. in other words she had to plant evidents.
Be aware i am michael2.will add a signature.The liers have found out that they cannot hide the truth anymore but do not stop lieing. In other words. Its a sad theater we are now seeing.
Try to convince me that there were no cameras available.........
Yeah-Dats da ticket. Loony #$%$. Boy-The Mushrooms didn't register till NOW I suppose ?
She also claims to have seen Bigfoot, ET, Loch Ness, and Elvis. So, it's your call.
I think George Bush told her to say it.
Perhaps she was afraid #$%$ Cheney would mistake her for his lawyer and shoot her in the face.
She sounds like a crackpot. Likely she's looking to score a few bucks off the late night tv circuit. I don't believe her at all.
so? the worlds technologies and navies cannot find this plane, but one woman did? b.s_ she is looking for some fame and quick money!
Inbred realative of Chicken Little. "Of the sky is falling fame"
15 minutes of fame does not get you 15% off your car insurance.
Duh, she is in a yacht.
Somebody get this lady a reality show. Quick, before she forgets how this story went.
She gave us freedom of choice: believe her story or believe she is nuts.
spy on plane? shot it down.this is likely what happen.
she saw it ya sure and I saw bigfoot yesterday
Yeah, me too. Big foot was singin' backup with the Jordonaires for Elvis.
you saw it too? I wasn't gonna go but elvis told me it was gonna be a great show
Hard to trust anyone that comes out with something like this 3 months later. It's a shame if it could have helped searchers.
Hallucination or not, In this age, I would have at least attempted to record the event....
I've never seen a jetliners navigation lights when they fly because they are too fare up. hmmmmm.
She was right the first time. She was going insane. Hope she gets help. I wish her the best.
the two other planes were north korean migs, shooting it down...(she'll remember that next month)
What was her blood alcohol level when she "saw the plane"?
Seems like the husband would confirm it as well ...he probably knows she's insane and refuses to collaborate her story
And she waited until now?? Sounds like someone looking for their 15 minutes or in CNN time 15 days.
I heard Sarah Palin spotted it outside her kitchen window.
@RBT it makes enough difference to make you put fingers to keyboard.
You should have noticed that it was a quote of a presumable fellow traveler of yours, Hillary and as a retort to Palin bashing.
I noticed. However, I did not make a connection with it. Since I didn't make a connection with it, then obviously I am not the target audience of the source from which your statement was quoted. My original snarky comment was intended to be recognizable by the masses. Due to Ms. Palin's statements' notoriety, I achieved this goal. The source of your quoted statement wasn't noticed nearly as much as Ms. Palin's comment, therefore was not recognized, which defeated your intended purpose, whatever that was.
You gotta be kidding me. Hillary's remark, made before Issa's committee has been blasted across the cable news on nearly a daily bases and will be throw in her face as a presidential aspirant. You achieved your goal of your remark getting to the masses? Where do you get this notion? "defeated your intended purpose, whatever that was.". . . .Read the last sentence of my second reply. Comprehension problem, have you?
Your error is stating "blasted across the cable news". I am not dumb enough to pay for TV and sit through commercials. I didn't see the "blasting". I achieved my goal using an easily recognizable statement, of which, even I heard of, out on the internet. Who knows how many people read it. Only 3 people liked it, and 1 person just can't let go of one tiny little snarky comment. In short, the comment I made is still much more well known than the one you made. Cut the cord! Pick things up here and there. Get to the point where you don't care who "wins" and just try to sift through actual information and not the talking head "blasting" whatever point of view they want you to think. Many times, the comments on here are much more informative than the articles. Of course you have to breeze through the comments who are committed to the "cause" they chose.
. I watch both cable and more often than not the news on antenna TV to wit: PBS and the flag ship network stations. Other than that I have no idea of what you are babbling about. I replied to your comment and latter replied again, as you can reread, What is it that you do not understand? What #$%$, " My original snarky comment was intended to be recognizable by the masses." Man, can you babble!
There you go still putting fingers to keyboard, and you say I can babble.
You gotta be a clown. Putting fingers to a keyboard is one thing, the content is babble and that is what you do. Your original comment was not apropos to the article and nothing more than a cheap shot at Palin. The comment was not clever, not informative, just cheap. From my replies you might think I am championing Palin, I am not and don't want to see her as VP. Your assertion that your comment somehow wins some Nielson rating is absurd and silly You sound like some kid that lives in mommy and daddy's basement and needs their health insurance. Are you?
Don't ask any questions, so she could see black smoke coming from the plane at night, so what? That's totally plausible LOL.
LOL, yeah....sure! Her and every other #$%$ playin in the water!
" There was what appeared to be black smoke behind it." -- But didn't she say it was nighttime? Maybe it was a bright evening with a full moon......or, she's full of it.
This woman is day dreaming, there is no support from husband of the event. Why she didn't tell him? I think she had camera and could record this event. Even if true story, no one can believe.
she was smoking some real good #$%$, she is still recovering....that thing is parked someplace to be used against us later...is my opinion
Suddenly a distant cry is heard in a southern accent "I SEEN THE SWAMP MONSTER !" then another voice yells in a consoling tone "ok, ok...it's time for your medicine"
Good luck with this one.......another UFO sighting, the husband was their but didn't see anything. Alas...a trail of black smoke at night an orange fire ball and two planes flying overhead watching this all take place......Hello!!!!!!!!
Good photo, Yahoo ........ another failure.
SURE you did, dear. That's nice.
She may not have "believed her eyes at the time", but I don't believe her eyes now. Sorry.
I'll bet she saw Jimmy Hoffa bailing out of the plane.
I was sailing in the Bering Strait and I saw a UFO lay a Tractor Beam on that jet and was dragging into the saucers cargo hold and took off.
Hope she kept a log book. Or journal.
Liar, Liar,.. Your pants are on FIRE! REALLLLY believing this one!
Maybe she smoke to much dakine!
so what she want to say is that the plan was escorted to the indian ocean then shoot down by two military jets ? seems to be a big operation but why
Stay off the Go Go Juice Lady. I once saw a UFO land on my neighbors roof. NOT.
Yeah, I saw it too. It was the same day that I saw the Easter Bunny and Elvis.
Wait till her book and movie come out.
I put a tooth under my pillow last night and the tooth fairy left me a quarter.
Maybe she should have had a little more confidence in herself???? Maybe she had a little too much Jack Daniels in herself. Or maybe she is "insane".
Next she will report she saw a flying saucer pick up the plane in its beam.
so once again I was high on mesc.... and was at the movies watchin this film called "Towering Inferno" at the movie theater..... that was back when they had the projector film type movies... and they started showing the part where the skyscraper was catchin on fire.... and something happened to the projector right at that moment and the film got stuck and in about 1 or 2 seconds the film started to burn and bubble right there on screen with the "Towering Inferno" on fire also.... then we could start to smell the burning film also right there... it was so real.... It was a real trip.... completely insane .. I mean in this film, the building in the film was on fire and the film caught on fire.... I mean insane like being on a boat in the middle of the Indian Ocean and looking up and seeing a huge passenger jet cruising overhead on fire....
Right! What kind of person is going to see something this horrific, know that a plane went missing and NOT report it. Even after seeing all over the news how this plane is missing. What a maroon!
Yeah right, after all this time she comes forward
Why didnt they print the entire scope of what this women said she saw? How long did she see it? Where did it go? Did she see it crash? What a dumb article.
What a whackjob. No way I'd give this lady a single ounce of credibility. Nothing about her story makes any sense at all.
I saw a whole bunch of fireworks and bright lights while smoking dope and I swear I saw not one, but two Malaysia MH370.
I saw the plane in my pool last night !
and now you know why she didn't say anything earlier.
I thought I met BigFoot, but his wiener was too small for him to be BigFoot.
Maybe she saw a load of spew shot over her face while stoned on vodka
Looney Tunes lady just wants some publicity
yea..and it was still flying under water when she saw it!!...Think she's been on the water a little too long!
Is she lying because she's seeking her 15 minutes of fame or is she lying as part of the cover up?
That's not a sail boat, she needs to put down the pipe...
She only NOW comes forward???? I find that hard to believe!
so there was another edward snowmen on board or something and i dont knows why they cant just arrest thees people at the other airport they keeps shooting down passenger planes
Can't believe a Brit because they're potted all the time.
The plane got sucked into the Twilight Zone and all the passengers are being greeted by Rod Sterling
im glad she's saying something but why wait three months before comming forward to say something?
Crocket just called and he wants his GoBoat back! lol
#$%$,CNN anchors just hopped back on their mechanical bull again.
whatever happened to reporting to actual news rather than reporting hearsay?
she saw a burning jet crash, but didnt think it was important enough to report right away........hummnnn ?
She should be charges and jailed. Selfish byt che.
She did not believe her eyes at the time, but THREE MONTHS later she comes foreward!? Yeah, sounds to me like she is crying out for 15 mins. of fame!
Reminds me of the Bermuda Triangle episodes in the 70's . A Plane crashes and not one politician or anyone would prefer a "theory" over an actual fact. This has been going on since the Koran/bilbe/.......etc.
those other jets were prolly the ones that shot it down...
your mom is a prolly. a big prolly wolly
China shot it down in their air defense zone
OK She says it was at night, and She saw some orange lights with "what appears to be black smoke behind it"??? In the dark of night she saw black smoke? Way the H*** out in the middle of the ocean? I don't think so.... sorry Charlie....
The biggest news story of 2014! You might want to disclose your info a little sooner than 3 months later. Doh!
I was sailing and saw an #$%$ saying she saw a plane.
People do anything for 15 mins fame anymore !
send her to the national enquirer.
shes lying most likly just trying to get attention
So let me get this right; a oil rig worker saw a plane on fire...reported it... but NO ACTION. Now this lady...reporting a plane on fire. I think its now clear. Aliens people. ALIENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If it is more likely that you are insane than that you might have seen a meteor...you should not be allowed out in public.
theyre all wrong, the plane went into orbit and docked with the international space station
Didn't believe her eyes at the time? I wouldn't believe her mouth at this time.
"I was smoking a joint late at night on the deck and stargazing at the time. I saw all of this, and thought that it might not be important enough to share until now, you see..." "the two other planes above it moved at lightning speed and then, they just vanished, poof!" I hit the doobie a few more times and went off to bed, never turning on the TV or the radio until now. It was some good thai weed!
looking for her 15 minutes. I dont believe it.
Somebody check this wack jobs crack pipe!
It fits with what I thought happened to it. Boeing will try to sweep that under the rug and fast!
she has a radio on board if her story was true DUH she would have used it
----and Bigfoot was in the cockpit with a gun pointed @ the captain, ya-da-ya-da
I saw the plane too. In my sleep.
This lady is very right. Everyone should listen to her. She IS insane.
Hmmm... I wonder what she was smoking...
Did she see a white rabbit?
Oh yes, only coming forward now. What a crock of BS!
Nut seeking her 15 minutes of fame.
It only took me about forty-five seconds to read your comment, give you a thumb's down and write this comment. You have about 14 minutes and 15 seconds fame left.
Yeah, I"m sure she did and Scooby Doo n Mickey Mouse were sitting in the Captain n Co-Pilots seats !!!
Lets not forget about ET riding the bike across the sky overhead..:)
was this chick tripping on acid?
I don't believe a word she is saying. She waited this long to say something. Yeah shes credible.
If that's true she should be tried for treason.
well good give the authorities the cordinates so they can go find them..
One day last week, Tuesday precisely, a lightning strike surged through a silver car parked on a business street where I work. It happened 10:15 AM. That is my first break period. Reaching into my desk's bottom drawer to pull out my flask of Goslings Black Seal rum the air resonated with a tremendous clasp of thunder. Instinctually I grabbed the rum with two hands and quickly placed the bottle to my lips. After a swallow of rum. Six for exactness, I glanced out the office window and witnessed a Delorean racing down the street accelerating fast. Then, like a homerun baseball the Delorean disappeared. I chose to dust this from memory. I feel terrible. I waited until noon to break out the rum again and, I feel terrible.
Only a person with Loose Screws on their head will believe her story...
How amazing.... I saw it too ! It's amazing how much BS Yahoo drums up when there is nothing to report !
I saw it too. Sorry I didn't say something sooner.
hmmm 2 more planes on top of it...maybe it was being lead by alien ships to outerspace such a strange version!!!
not sure how much credit you're supposed to give to a story from someone who admits : "... I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.”
Her 15 minutes of fame !!
Have her contact CNN ASAP ! They will give her a newshour of her own so they can continue reporting this story ad infinitum.
I find this a bit outrageous-so she is just now coming foreward? Why didn't come foreward a mth ago? 2 mths ago?
Yea ok all the media coverage on this and she just thought about it I THINK SOMEONE IS TRYING TO HAVE THERE 15MINS OF FAME BULLS$%#T I SAY
As I said before, this is a cover up of epic proportions. We will never know what happened....ever. An eye witness report pops up months later??? Come on?
It took her brain synapses 3 months to connect to her eyes.. sounds like someone you would want to trust
The plane was shoot down by military airplanes. From which country? idk Why? idk: a mistake? because of some of the ppl on board? Again idk but that is was happened. As it already happened before in the past (check the Ustica disaster for example).
at least she now said something of missing flight, that could give clue on where it went down
So, she saw a black smoke trail? At night? GTFO!!!
honestly,she is probably just another crackpot or attention seeker. sounds farfetched
What was she taking at the time of the sighting?
We will treat it like a UFO. We saw something, but we didn't know what it was.
She doesn't know what she saw and now we don't either.
I think she was on some stuff she is right but thanks anyway
I would have to agree with her first assessment. It was more likely she was going insane. She may have arrived there at this point.
Wait a minute....you saw a downed plane, you said nothing. Instead of seeking help you questioned your own mind and sat on this information for months while families and search/rescue look for the plane? Ummmmm something just don't seem right about this.
I think it was Dr. Evil and Mini Me in his flying "Big Boy" coming back to earth looking for Austin Powers!
WAIT.......I saw Jesus hangin' out with Tupac, Jim Morrison and the gang from Lost...... I just didn't know it at the time!
Um was she out sailing the who time this tragedy happened? Did she just pull into port like last night and caught up on the latest or in her case past events. I bet she is rich and thought only about her sailing Indian ocean and disturbing her leisure timmme, forget about the smokey trailed orange glowing commercial air plane streaking through the sky. Orange glow, black smoke coming out the tail end on a commercial Airplane= fire. I am pretty sure she has a radio on that boat and could have made a simple call but noooooooooo. Do they really expect us to believe such a story just stupid.
That looks like the same boat the Geico gecko is driving around the little pond!!
Shot down by two "soviet migs" is Probably More The Real Story. Ah.. Putin.. thy Reach is Far!
perhaps she just saw that big ol moon and freaked out like Tom Hanks in Joe vs the Volcano
What some won't do for their 15 Minutes...
In the night............and she saw black smoke?? In the night?? Really??
This what Happens when you do METH while sailing.
I like the part where this didn't happen.
The other two aircraft where X Wing fighters.
So she was high or no one would give her money for her story??
Here's a novel idea...go check the area that she claims to have viewed the plane...if it's not there she will need to get the PING in her head checked :-)
I saw J*sus in a corn flake but did not come forward until now because I ate the corn flake. Flake is the key word hear.
She did not believe her eyes and I don't believe her.
When does the book come out?
OBAMA knows where the plane is
Well unlike most of the jack holes here, I am glad she came forward and I hope somehow this will help with the search...embarrassing
“Will this help the authorities of the families get closure?" Absolutely... not!
She forgot to mention bigfoot was flying the plane!
And Elvis was on top of it singing Hunka hunka burnin love!
Oh gee I saw it also, where is my 15 minutes of fame?? Its in Diego Garcia, check the hangers!!
Can't say i believe the story.. eyewitness accounts are notoriously unreliable.
And she just now wants to say something? After how many months? Something ain't stirring the KoolAid here. I think someone wants their 15 min.
Tee is a lying sack of #$%$.
Yes she saw it I'm sure, and was told to keep quiet! I believe it and it's what I've been saying to myself all along that the plane was shot down! You can't trust the Cia/FEMA, Government, etc!
she said there was two other planes going the other way why haven't the pilots on those planes come foward
Because there would have to be two other planes with pilots going the other way.
this entire report is bogus; nothing about it sounds true...why weren't the other 2 planes she saw on the radar?
true story...I stayed in a Holiday Inn Express.
I saw Jimmy Hoffa get in a car with the Goodfellas, but I thought they were his friends.
So she didn't report it because she thought she was hallucinating from shrooms?
I call #$%$ ... just a person trying to get exposure.
I saw it too. It's right over there.
Can't help wonder what she was smoking that night.
Her first thought was that she was going insane?
You got your cheap 15 seconds of fame. Now YOU should be ashamed of yourself!!!!
I call #$%$ on this one
Piloted by Bigfoot, with Santa standing by as co-pilot.
Dont believe any of that b s story !! she saw it but thought she was hallucinating !!!! lol
"i thought it was more likely that i was going insane"...this, unfortunately, speaks volumes.
Sounds like she is a Batty nut case
In her oxygen starved brain state of mind in a sworn statement
She must be on Crack two other planes really!!
my personal opinion is that military (not US military) shot down airplane by accident and now they are trying to hide it so they don't look like bunch of #$%$
Not shot down by U.S. military is correct.They would have missed.
this confirms what ive been saying all along , this plane was shot down by somebody and then it was covered up
Whats wrong with all you people this plane thing is all a hoax~no plane,no passengers,paid actors=one big HOAX! We are being feed a big line of #$%$.
15 minutes of fame starting NOW!
I wouldn't believe a word this woman says. She states that she saw either an airplane on fire or a meteorite, but then says it was MORE LIKELY that she was going insane!! Really, is she joking?! Shut up and go back on your meds...
Her boat has no sail. There are rumors her story is untrue like the 'boat' being not real.
They say if you spend to much time at sea you can get delusional
Was she high on dope at the time?
I am skeptical that you could see black smoke and a burning plane at night. You may be able to see smoke in a night sky, but with the relatively bright light of a burning plane, I'm not sure your eyes could adjust to the contrast....kind of like headlights coming at you at night and recognizing the driver of the car. Also....with the worldwide exposure of the missing plane, waiting 3 months to mention it. I doubt it.
Did she also see Elvis riding on the back of a whale during her journey?
Holy oragne lights and smoke the British are coming.
I`ll bet that she saw Alice and Toto too!
Sorry folks but that ain't no sailboat in the pic
And she managed to see black smoke tens of thousands of feet in the air against the backdrop of a night sky, how?
remember the so called evidence of the plane dropping down to about 8,000 feet? and btw, i have seen the space station zip by on a clear night before. it would be possible.
Seems to me if the "orange glow" from the fire was BRIGHT ENOUGH, that would light up the black smoke in the night sky. Think about it. I agree she was dumb not to report this as soon as she was back on land, (or by satellite phone if they had one on board.) And what is that toy boat simulation in the video? NOT a sailboat!
she probably had to wait for all the stuff she was smoking to leave her system before she reported it
You know how when you close your eyes and put pressure on your eyeballs...That's what she saw
i think i saw it while fishing at crab orchard lake in Illinois
...A L I E N S...
It's in the belly of a UFO!! Close Encounters of the Third Kind
The plane incident never happend , rockafeller had some interst in a new microchip someone had invented and Ive heard they were on this plane.1+1 = ?
does anybody know the title of her book yet ??
If that is the kind of vessel she was on, she wasn't sailing and 2 if you saw a low flying 777 on fire and didn't believe it ... what were you drunk or high ... why believe you now
how much did the goverment pay this people too cover their #$%$
If her claim of what she saw was true and accurate, there is an implication that it was shot down .... very doubtful.
And I saw the Lochness Monster while I was at the bar last week...
i do believe her. as a matter of fact, she is not the 1st person to mention another plane close to the missing plane...
If she doesn't have a latitude/longitude, who cares?
She's nuts! All these countries looking for that plane with sophisticated gear and she just happens to see it on fire??!!
Maybe some day when we least expect it someone will find Malaysian 370...
This dumb b---h been in a coma since March 7th ?
Not even mrs.halluci knows the facts.
Any normal person would report this to someone? Why even mention it now,10 weeks later?
Not at sea for an extended period. You see too much strange stuff out there. Been there and done that. You need to check out a "dead calm" under clear skies at night....the world looks upside down.
Sarah - if you want us to follow you on Twitter, you better give us a reason. Give us some detail!!! Night? Day? Where was her ship when she saw this? Did the plane drop into the ocean? Was she abducted by aliens? Was Elvis on the boat with her?
Can we all say "15 minutes of fame?"
Did anyone think to ask her if she had seen Elvis or maybe even Jimmy Hoffa?
unreal, people will do anything for attention
I saw it , and I live in Texas.
Quick, someone get my tin hat for me so that I can join in the commentary here
Oh here we go! I saw it! No, I saw it!
Could she not write down her coordinates at the time Most real sailors take notes of where the hell they are!!!
sure she did, now cnn will believe themselves
stupid... stupid... stupid... Oh yeah and STUPID!
Duh. A plane was on fire with black smoke. What if a plane saw a boat on fire with black smoke. Duhhhh
GD gotta be, blotter got on top of me, got me seeing E MF'ing T.
The woman is a nut & she's making this up.
It flew over my backyard in America. Oh ho ho ho ho.
I thinks I saw it too. I was siting at the beach taking a dose of my medicinal smoke and there it was, right in front of me diving into the ocean. This needs to be checked out. I still hear the pinging in my head.
The reason they haven't found the plane is because they don't want to, that plane was brought down!
What the heck, if I claim to have seen it, will I become famous, too? Okay, put me down for sighting a fireball that night. The name's Hitler Christ, by the way. I'll take all the publicity I can get, good or bad - doesn't matter. I'm insane.
OMG. This will get Richard from CNN, who always is a bit looney on to a new high. Please Anderson Cooper, we beg of you, don't report this story. Like someone would wait months to report what they saw! Insanity for sure.
It ws the very short guy on the boat that kept yelling, "da plane, da plane!"
Unfortunately, this seems as good a lead as any other....
Translation: she forgot to refill her meds.
Maybe she was on the sauce and only saw a firefly.
Sounds like a fish story to me. Why wait so long ?????
She needs to put the cork back in the bottle......
Sure She Did. " I saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus." I never told a soul until now! Hey, It's the Truth.
This whole thing is a scam...never happened
They execute people with drugs in many of the countries she was near. Maybe they had to unload all the drugs before coming forward. And it sounds like she was sampling the goods too.
Did she see the Loch Ness monster too?
I thought I saw a putty tat.
What kind of person's first reactions are "I thought I was insane or hallucinating'?
Usually, if someone says: "I thought I was going insane," then they probably are.
Let them pass along their sailing charts to the authority's
Yeah! I saw bigfoot last week to. Does that count for anything?
what a liar, why didn't she speak up earlier, she just wants attention.
Let the kooky Amelia Earhardt claims begin !
After being on the ocean for a few days and consuming several bottles of fine cognac,it's really quite possible she did see flight MH370,as well as Elvis,Jimmy Hoffa and a whole bunch of others..
I believe the random person I've never seen or meet in my life vs. any news station or countries word!
another fuuny and gossip because if she was really seen that kind of things she would call the police or some source.doesnt she watch the news,doesnt she read the news paper?new story just sellibg the news paper and waste the other money to find msa370.dont trust that women after 3months she remember that she has been seen some things...whats the hell she is talking now..dd
one day in 1981 at 1145 pm I sat with a friend in my pick up truck on Long Island and herd a low grumble and felt the ground shake , we both thought some ones oil burner blew up and we waited to hear sirens and never herd anything until the papers headline read 1 million gal gas storage tank in Newark new jersey blew up my house 72 miles away
She's been out on the water too long. Didn't she say she saw mermaids too?
and she says she wasn't hallucinating? lol
And Bigfoot was doing the backstroke across the Indian Ocean at the same time. IT"S TRUE! SHE SAW IT!
Anderson al-cooper at CNN/al-jazeera-USA better get right on this.
If there is any truth to it Fox will not cover it
she does not sound credible. of course the conspiracy nut jobs will have a field day with this.
Sounds like a whack case to me.
I'll go with the "going insane/hallucinating" hypothesis ~
I saw the boogey man yesterday - which is about as believable as this woman
" But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Yup.
Sail on Tee, and give up that "pot" smoking. `cuz no telling what you`ll "see" next time.
I don't believe her story even if she thought she was hallucinating? wasn't someone else with her you mean to tell me in this day and age she didn't bother to snap some pictures? and she waits this long to come forward something sounds like a 15 min. fame.
Insane. That's the ticket. Why come forward now?
Picture reminds me of the movie Airplane. They had the sound of a prop engine plane when showing the jetliner. Too funny and most people never noticed.
Forget about that airplane folks.. They are busy claiming a small islands for now...
No quotes from the husband? Maybe he was asleep while his wife was at the helm after eating 3 ounces of magic mushrooms, dropping acid and smoking a joint!
The same woman saw Jesus on a piece of toast.
...And why didn't this woman says something a little sooner?
Just let this stupid story go!! I saw the flight in my dreams!! it's at the bottom of the ocean!
Stop it! She is either on crack or is mental. She is kidding, right, because no human in their right mind would wait so long to inform authorities about what she claim to have seen. And i'm with "Quiet"...seeing smoke in the sky at night...over the ocean? ONLY if the moon was full and the plane happen to fly in its light. Stop telling this ridiculous story.Shame on you!
this smells like another rotten lead from someone seeking publicity.
What a shock!! She didn't JUST see the plane on fire....she saw two other planes!! Oh brother.
Jay Carney said he saw the plane too.
Ya ever see "Wag the Dog?" Shoes man...shoes
Okay..15 minutes of fame is over.. now SHUT-UP!
wait, they're still looking for that airline? dang girl.. oh well, either they're all dead or perhaps stripped naked and forced as slaves in some terrorist country...
"Oh, and it looked like it was being piloted by Bigfoot or Elvis, I'm not sure which"
I hope this helps bring this story to a close. Why on earth she wait 3 months to talk about this is beyond me.
her husband didnt see anything, he was lightingng the bong
Why is this coming out now and not when the plane went missing???
She was really busy developing her film of the Loch Ness Monster.
Liar, looking for her 15 minutes of fame. Balloon Boy II.
Oh , so it wasnt the aliens that abducted the plane??? lol
People on 'ludes should not drive boats. Or have their comments posted.
she might still want to consider she is going insane. i wonder how much she's gotten paid for her story....
Uhhhhh, slow news day? "Man bites dog!!!!" Read all about it!
Someone with brain power at this low level was sailing across an ocean! Husband's comments? Approx location? Stupid story.
So she is JUST reporting this now? maybe she actually was hallucinating!
I don't believe her. At all.
I'm sorry I just want to be in the news since my long voyage affected my eye sight.....next claim.
this article dosent address two important questions did she take or think to take a picture? did her husband also witness it?
This woman was also quoted as seeing the floating head of Zsa Zsa Gabor that same night, running parallel to the moon.
Why did she think she was hallucinating? Was she eating shrooms?
Pretty hard to see smoke AT NIGHT! Even with a full moon!! Also, the flight was not on it's original flight plan so WTH??
Been around the globe four times on ships. At sea in the moonlight, and even on a bright starry night, you can see smoke. And I don't mean tobacco or Maui Wowee.
Been camping many times, burning old rubber tires,,,makes the blackest smoke. Can't see it once it's 50 feet overhead.
The plane had people on it....sad that no tracking system what so ever was enabled.
I saw it to. It flew over my house in Texas.
What's wrong with what she said , I know I was sitting next to her and watching the plane while feeding her vodka .
She didn't beleive her eyes, why should I believe her mouth? Fake!
Someone needs to stick something long and hard down this woman's throat so that her lies can be silenced.
And Yahoo used A Picture of a Power boat when she said she was sailing,..
What was in her water pipe? Two planes, fire, smoke who did the shooting and why?
I never believed the official version of TWA 800 either. I think it is well North of where they are searching......fill in the blanks yourselves.
One thing is for sure. All aboard are dead.
Crazy b****! She is just looking for her 15 minutes.
I taught I taw a puddie cat. I really did.
Why is she waiting so long to come forward. Did she see it hit the water. Does she know exactly where it was............
Did this lady take some photos ?
This has been in the news forever. Why just now telling us? It should be no trouble to check flight plans for the planes she saw if she can give a date. All planes have to file one.
This is why you don't drink & sail at the same time.
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane." Very strange comment.
This has the smell of fish all over it....or....wait a minute, that might be marijuana. Never mind.
One question...if it was during the night when she saw this plane...how could she tell it was black smoke trailing behind it? Most airplanes leave a trail of white exhaust, even at night!
And she waited 3 months to come forward with her story?
bull*#%$, She just now is mentioning this. As an afterthought.
well she got her 15 minutes and her certification she's nut's she saw navigation's light over the glow of flames and smoke lol righty ohh
I don't see any sails on the boat in the pic.
I saw bigfoot but decided not to tell anyone...
I call BULLSH_T on this one.
"Tee feels bad for not saying something sooner." Get of the crack pipe.
Good Grief! How long was this woman at sea? Just now coming out with this?
I am going to go with the part of her story that she says she is insane. Nucking Futs is more like it.
YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!!!! Me too!!!!! I saw it flying over the North Pole, Sanity Claus took it out with an air to air missle. It's true, Rudolph pulled the trigger.
Full of #$%$ much? Ok lady, you got you 5 minutes of questionable fame...now get back on your meds.
Peyote will do that to you.
Wow...this woman sounds like a complete headcase. What do you wanna bet she has a boob job.
I say BUNK !!! This rumor would suggest that the plane had crashed in to the ocean ... so debris would have been found by now !!!
I'm calling BS on her story.
so what is this sighting or ping #753......if they are in the ocean, by now the fish have been fed, time to move on.
If both she and her husband were sailing together, then where was he when this was going on? Did he see it as well? Was he asleep at the time?: What does he have to say about all this?
if your going to put a model of a sailboat make sure its a sailboat and you wouldn't be taking something like that in the ocean anyways.
The missing plane is either Kolob or Xenu who knows all for Mormons and Scientologists. Aliens from outer space were the founders of both cults.
I imagine myself, some ten years hence, reading a story about someone coming across the wreckage, solving the "mystery of the decade".
same here , one day it will happen
There is no plane. This is a test. We have our answer. They'll believe anything.
I'll have my 15 minutes now, please.
I've spotted Loch Ness while sailing, Big foot while hiking, and Jimmy Hoffa's body while walking my dog. I'm only confessing now because I didn't believe my eyes back then. Yea.........
A bit odd This just happens to pop out of her mouth right now
She probably claims to have seen Bigfoot and Nessie the loch ness monster as well. Hey, it got her name in the headlines and that's most likely what she was after.
Sounds more like someone seeking their Andy Warhol 15 minutes of fame...
When women do not have good sex they make up things. Her husband is old and is short so that explains the sex life. Then we she did have sex, she suddenly making things up.
Something very wrong with this....not reported until now? Forget about it.
She probably saw Amelia Earhart, cause she didnt see MH370
They had 5278 sightings of Nessie in Loch Ness, all of people, who were 100% convinced they saw the dame, anything between 3 foot and 400 foot long and in all colors of the rainbow and then some. So much for witness accounts.
please....there were two guys with patents on their worth billions.....now their company owns them....plus 22 people from the same company on one plane? really? people and planes aren't worth billions to these animals. i bet that plane was confetti at 35k ft.
why did t take so long to come forward?
some women claim that the white house nword is human, woman can be very dilusional
No doubt... Another "truth" something, that obama is hiding from the entire world....
so was it a sail boat or a power boat... more worthless reporting from gayhoo.
Yahoo doesn't "report". It publishes stories form other sources, in this case the Daily Caller. Get a clue next time?
Was Bigfoot flying one of the planes?
How was she sailing on a motor boat?
The plane got lost while on its way to pick up Jimmy Hoffa.
So what does her husband say? "She's insane!" or "Yeah, I saw the same thing."
I saw Bigfoot at the Mall back in March but didn't report it either...makes as much sense?
The woman making a story 3 months after it happened.
See managed to see black smoke on a dark night?
Yes, yes, great, terrific, but................how does this advance the Gay Agenda? Is the witness bi-curious, or at least transgendered? If not, then it leaves us right back where we started.
'agenda' most overused word, EVER. Bacteria, have an agenda.
No, 'EVER' is the most overused, especially with ALL CAPS.
Okay so now flight MH370 was brought down by UFOs. Now all the nuts are coming out of the woodwork.
Another goose chase. Other planes? could it have been shadowed and shot down? the theories can be endless. they will never find it. Another Amelia Erhart story we will be speculating about for the next hundred years.
So where are the photos, my dear?
I can hear the pinging now along with the book deal.
Not only that, but Elvis was flying it!
#$%$ just to get a story
THAT BRIT DATA FOISTED ON THE MALAYSIANS IS NO GOOD
Thanks. Coming from you that is appreciated. Leave your number or last know address with the switchboard.
"Two other planes well above it." You mean the ones used by US and Israel to shut down the satellite tracking equipment of Flight MH370. Lady, watch your back.... you better take a trip to Russia, and stay with that other whistleblower.
A LITTLE OUT OF THE WAY FOR ISRAEL ISN'T IT?(2500+ MILES?)
Better tighten up your tin foil hat , the rays are sneaking through.....
sounds flaky to me, her and her story
if a boat uses a motor is it still considered sailing?
guess they could not do a graphic of a "sail" boat.
She was fishing for the Loch Ness Monster at the time.
"Woman Claims She Saw Missing Malaysian Air Flight"... and Elvis was in the cockpit!
Malaysia Airlines.....Straw grabbing contest ends soon......so grab your story and get it out NOW....while their still listening........said the mind of MONEY!
I saw bigfoot the other day.
Oh No! CNN will reboot the story and go on for weeks on this tripe!
She couldn't reported before because she was kidnapped by Sasquatch.
You dont have to beleive her,but shes just as beleiveable as these countries who have handled the whole situation by lieing and hiding #$%$
A plane on fire, the whole world looking and can't find it and she stays silent? None of that makes sense.
she's a drunk liar, I bet
One wicket short of a full cricket game mate.
I wanna be famous!!! I saw something and I'll add two other planes to make it sound like a conspiracy...I waited three months because it has taken me that long to sober up....
sounds like a group of DUMBASZ republicons on her trying to figure????
"It did occur to me that it might be a meteorite. But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” And just like you were then, you still are....NUTS!!!!
I saw it too....i was out on the Indiam Ocean with friends and we saw a fireball and smoke....we didnt think anything of it....we just continued to smoke our weed and took a few hits of LSD. we saw 2 other planes too....they were towing it to shore.....i saw osama bin laden taking the lead and was the head captain.... and I saw marilyn monroe on board sucking elvis presley. ...i just thought i was tired..and hallucinating....i saw sammy , frankie and dean too but
sounds like it was shot down
Sailing? Really where is the Sails on the Animation! Thanks Lamoo! News! Why did she not say it sooner? WHAT A HOAX!
lets see she makes a baseless claim of positive proof of seeing the jet months AFTER its been all over the internet and every known news network you watch she will get a call from animal planet to come work with "Bobo" to track down bigfoot after all theyve had such success at finding evidence of them
This lady saliors sighting of a burning airplane...fit with the Chinese reported seafloor event....the two plane crash theory....one MH370, and the other a ultra secret spy drone....keep in mind a jungle crash does not reveal debris, and spy done material does not float. See article " Chinese researchers say a seafloor event may have been linked to MH370". Yes this might be flimsy evidence....but, the so called solid evidence thus far, has been fruitless.
Sounds like a tall tale (like in fishtail).
Last weekend I got drunk and saw Elvis! I think it was Elvis - I'm pretty sure it was.
Smokin' the reefer.....I bet ET was on his bike chasing the plane too.
Great, more fodder for conspiracy theorists. She sees a scene like that, but doesn't think she should mention it. Sounds like all those UFO sightings that used to happen in the 1960s.
She probably saw it after smoking pot all day....
There's .... someone on the wing... some... thing!
And I just spotted Elvis in the 7-11 parking lot!
I saw it too! Can I get MY 15 minutes of fame now?
She didn't place a call to the authorities, but probably did to the National Enquirer for $$.
It does make you think ... and why wasn't she below deck making a sandwich?
And on her knees doing me and the floors, talk about swabbing the deck matey..
Wake up people, it was shot down...
I think her story should be checked out to determine approximately WHERE she was when she viewed this plane and possibly search in THAT area .. The other planes nearby sure as hell weren't sent to "RESCUE" the big jet .. perhaps THEY shot the Big Jet Down !!! Shades of 9-11 .
Oh boy, another whack job coming oujt of the woodwork. It is good for the conspirqacy nut jobs, because they seem bored lately.
I saw it when sitting on my back pouch smoking a little mother nature.
How do you say "nut job" in British?
Oh Nooooooo! This will keep CNN busy for at least three more weeks.
this version of her story is different then the one published last night.
Eyewitness accounts are never really accurate
It makes me wonder who was on that plane that they wanted to get rid of so badly. How else do you loose a whole pane load of people like that. And screw up the search afterwards?
I saw it too. Jimmy Hoffa was in the pilots seat. D.B. Cooper was the co-pilot and Nick Cage was the flight engineer, and fire starter.... Man... some people have some RICH imaginations....
So Katherine --was there a Boat beached nearby with S.S. Minnow on the side?---and why are all Brit Women named Katherine?
I don't believe her. Why wait until now? BTW, where did they get this stock image of boat being driven by cybermen?
A fifth of Jack Daniels will do that to you!
Why not take a quick pic of the burning plane?
I was also smoking on my terrace that day and saw the same elongated ball of fire! Why am I not in the news? CNN this is your chance - please do get in touch with me and you'll have something to sell for the next week or so! After all you milked the hunt for seaweed for a month or so!
Puff, puff, snort, snort, sniff. What was that?
Just puffing and listening to Jimmy Buffet
I actually believe her, If it was me I would not have reported it either.....I figure the other planes would have
I seen it too when I was swimming in my pool .
I call bu||sh|t! Oh...and by the way...I just remember that I saw a second guy shooting Kennedy. But I'm only coming forward now because...my phone wasn't working. Yeah. THAT'S IT...that's the ticket!
I wish she would share whatever she was smoking that night......
And I was absolutely sure there was a second gunman on the grassy knoll.......
But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Stick with that.
Silly woman. It was the SS Minnow. (why is there a power boat picture when she said she was "sailing"?)
she sounds like someone who had she lived in the USA would be an odummer voter......she is whacky....brits need to get there teeth fixed......go have another......
I saw it while shrimping in the gulf of mexico... but I'm just coming forward now because I was #$%$ wasted.
Why wouldn't they sail over to the burning plane? If they are sailing in the middle of the ocean, what is a few more hours of sailing?
Shut up you publicity seeking B/!/t
That power boat depicted must get amazing gas milage.
"Yeah! Me and some friends were just sitting there dropping acid when all of a sudden, like from OUT OF NOWHERE!..."
Mrs. Tee question, do you have both oars in the water ?
Maybe looking for her 15 seconds...
Wow, thanks for the info!!! TWO MONTHS LATER!! Ding BAT!
Another media-seeking attention ho.....and of course shes white!!
I think this woman is full of #$%$! She tell her story now! It's stupid of her not to report it earlier. If she did saw it, why didn't she take a picture of it?! Sure you can use an iPhone, or any phone that can take pictures. Also, if there are 2 planes above the burning plane, why didn't those planes report it?! She's just seeking media attention!
I am serious, and don’t call me Shirley.
Way to report things in a timely manner, lady.
Smoking a little too much weed, eh?
I love the photo; looks like a tiny toy figure "steering" a tiny toy boat across a bathtub.
I don't like it. Looks like a PENlS.
Uh you feel bad? Really? Feel bad? Your in the middle of theocean the sky is lit up with fire and smoke.......and you just pass it by?
Duh. I saw this plane with smoke. But I didn't believe it was that flight because John F. Kennedy was the pilot. Then I dropped the other hit of acid.
Sounds Like Good Drugs she was on! Come on Lady this missing plane has been on every news station for months. Thanks Yahoo for giving this Lady her 5 minutes of Fame! I believe the plane is on Mars before I believe you saw it on Fire and didn't report it!
Aliens reported seeing what they believe is a British woman Katherine Tee sailing deep in the Indian Ocean while they were fishing
What ever happened to the fisherman's story the night the plane disappeared that they spotted flying unusually low.....in the area in question?
It's too bad it wasn't a 12 yr. old who saw this, he/she would have had more sense.
Lady's really a cat, to spot dark smoke at that time of the night, or she was on grass at that time
This woman is telling the truth. How do I know? Because I was watching her while she was watching the plane. She also came over to tell me she saw big foot swimming with Nessi.
I'm sorry but.....I don't believe a word of it. Three months go by without a word from her? Hallucinating or not, you should have reported it because it's better to be safe than sorry. Once again....she is full of Buffalo cookies!!
I think I saw Elvis at Kroger last night...
I dunno what she saw, but I pretty sure I would've been seeing 2 of them, cuz I was hammered.
So you see fire and its coming towards you and you don't radio it in #$%$
If you're in the Middle of the Indian Ocean I doubt that a radio is going to do you much good. If she had a satellite phone it would have been a different story.
I sure they had a radio or something, how would they call for help if there is emergency
Told you it was that left engine from day 1. I told you , I told you , I told you !
HEY I SAW THE PLANE TO WITH JETS MOVING AWAY FROM IT AFTER THEY SHOT IT DOWN
The real question is what were the other two planes and why did they not report it?
IF you see something say something.
i read someones theory of "it was shot down for some reason (maybe being used for a weapon) and there for there is no plane. She said she saw 2 planes with normal lights and thought it would have been called in. Im sticking to the theory..... shot it down..... cleaned it up for reasons we will never know.
Did she also see the UFO with Elvis & Jesus on it too ? If it was night time, how can she say that the supposed "smoke" trailing behind the long orange glowing plane, was black ?
Where is the giant eye rolling smiley when you need it? There is NOTHING about this woman's story that is credible. I'm surprised they would waste space in the news for this nonsense.
The moral of this story....have more confidence in yourself!........blaaaaaaaaa
Quote: "But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Why would she think that- did she eat too many MJ brownies like that NYT reporter in Denver did?
I see bright lights and smoke after smoking a huge doobie. I see other things to!
IVE WATCHED BETTER CARTOONS,UNABLE TO COME UPON ANYTHING AT ALL,THREE MONTHS LATER,SOMETHING HAS TO HAVE SURFACED BY NOW,UNREAL.
And soon she'll hold a press conference with Gloria Allred.
I was fishing in the ocean and saw the Titanic
She was right about hallucinating.....still is !
everyone wants their 15 minutes of fame.
Hervé Villechaize's Ex Wife = It's The Plane The Plane...
and for 3 months, with the possibility of saving lifes, she kept her mouth shut??? put her in jail!!!
How could her report have saved lives?
What if she said something the day of.. or the day after that or sooner than 3 months later and the people were still alive? and something could have been done You really don't understand that????
Why would you say anything in this case if you did not see something very unusual? All we do know about this plane is that don't have a freaking clue where it is.
Honey Look ! U.F.O flying with dark smoke trailing behind it, with glowing orange fire like, and two planes right above it.
Some women hear sounds from angelic choirs when they orgasm.......she seen a bright orange light......makes sense to me
You know, this one time I just started crying for no reason.
me too.....I just wants to believe.............
It also could have been the mother ship calling you back home!
yeah right nice try, she see the serial number on the plane too........
Way to feed those conspiracy theorists, Mrs. Tee. OK, you've done as much damage as you can do for one day. Now, go below and "blow your Horn". C-Pup
no lies on the internet...I saw the plane just yesterday flying over the Antarctic
I wonder if she saw the plane that hit the pentagon because we sure haven't...lol
Orange lights = fire? Smoke at dark ? Guilty of sweeping it under the carpet ? Fire would be freaking streaking and that is if it was a single engine two and l think you would assume it is a shooting star rather than a plane. Seeing smoke at dark - at what altitude ? Guilty of something = BS!
NO CELL PHONE ON BOAT,WITH A CAMERA,AND SHE SAID NOTHING TO HER HUSBAND,AND IF SHE SAW FLAMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN,SHE MOST LIKELY ABLE TO SEE IT GO DOWN,SHE WAS HAVING WITHDRAWLS,SHES HIGHER THEN THE PLANE ITSELF WAS.
aliens, aliens, that is all I can say about this
alien abduction explains everything! Just kidding!
Hmmm. If you read what Ms. Tee said again, you get the picture of someone who is high on something. She never saw a plane with orange lights and black smoke behind of it (genius), thought it was a meteor but thought it was herself going insane. Search for pic on the web and something tells me there is a probably a bigger reason why she did not come forward after looking at that pic. I'm just saying.
Sounds like she left out the part " i don't know, i was really drunk at the time"....
As weird and suspicious this news article is; there is an old saying that just might be apropos here: "Truth is stranger than fiction". For discussion's sake, assume for the moment that this woman WAS indeed telling the truth (NOT saying she is). Could this explain everything" I believe it would. For example: What if she really did see two planes high over it? Could it have been that this was a case of some entity (many possibilities) using rockets to blow that plane up and send it to the bottom of an ocean; in just moments. IF, this is true (NOT saying it is), it would indeed explain many things; at least to me. For one, we KNOW Chinese elements HATED the Malaysians. And they had demonstrated this (according to news articles before and during the searches) a number of times. Also, I never did see WHY China was sooooo unforgiving and hateful towards the Malaysian officials;who were trying desperately (IMHO) to solve a mystery that NO one (to date) has been able to solve. Anyway.....just some thoughts..................... patdee
Make darn sure there are no cracks in her crack pipe.
It's in a hanger somewhere waiting to be used as a weapon.
Someone flew that plane right up Obama's ^A^$^$^^
It's not late if we can find it later but I doubt it.
More and more loonies coming out on this topic
Everyone gets 15 minutes of fame.
Show us internet trolls her picture so we can judge if she is telling the truth :)
The fact that she sailed from India to Thailand tells me she's insane. Now she's just making stuff up.
YES,,,I THINK IT DISINTEGRATED,,,THE ORANGE AND SMOKE,,MUST BE WHAT BURNT IT UP,,
I hate movies that portray events that are physically impossible
So your first "jump to" idea on this sighting is that you're going insane .... ??
of course she did - I saw Jimmy Hoffa last week at a Taco Bell
We did have a early report from an oil rig off Vietnam.
please. that plane is chilling in the middle east somewhere.
Boy I didn't know sailboats could move without a sail.
She was in what are called the doldrums, which are the low wind areas near the equator. All sail boats used for world travel have engines too.
Bubba, I'm guessing you didn't see the reenactment. It wasn't a sailboat used for that. Errrr.
Yeah, I saw it too. Flew into the Hamptons a couple of weeks ago to share a faux crabmeat salad with christie brinkley and the kardashians
yeah while up in the mountains me, cheechs' & chong saw this orange glowing something also...it might have been the plane....come on now...
This is what happens when you drink salt water.
Obama's real birth certificate and that plane are lost for eternity!!!
how about that new thing called a camera dah you are sailing over the ocean to Thailand and not have a camera
And, of course, she didn't take the time to say "Hey Hubby, can you come here for a moment and take a look? I see something strange up in the sky". Doesn't pass the sniff test...
I seemed more reasonable that; No, it's not a plane... it's not a meteor.... Well, obviously I must be insane. Nutter!
It looked elongated because your vision gets blurred when you're drinking. Perhaps this wasn't in the darkest of night but around dusk? Might explain the orange glow.
She lying and she knows she lying.
What I said all along.. this plane was shot down buy someone,,,and this miss-direction during the search is so the black box will not be found,,
If you think your news story will get hits and make money, you can find anyone to say or do anything. I'm getting nakid and run around the block. Get your camera's out.
A very mysterious story with lots of twists and turns. It's like a scene out of the Twilight Zone. Can't wait for the movie version.
LOL WHAT A JOKE!!!!!!!! So 2 months later she 'THINKS" she saw something, I guess all the media coverage about the missing plane it never occured to her that MAYBE it was what she says she saw? Some people are so pathetic.............
Whoever shot this plane down is not talking for security reasons. Hmmm?
#$%$?! I'm sure if your f'ing sale was busted off and you were floating around at sea you'd want someone to help you. F'ing morons!!
Cocaine is one hell of a drug
Best game ever! Malaysia is the new hide-n-seek champions of the world.
WAS SHE A DRUG SMUGGLER ! ONLY SOMEONE WITH SOMETHING TO HID WOULD NOT SAY ANYTHING !
Oh come on..!!! The implication is these two planes shot down the airliner..and the BIG conspiracy begins to unfold......... I bet she's unstable........
What a crock of #$%$...she didn't see a dang thing.
Somehow, I don't believe this account.
I bet it was shot down.
Fine ...Then Muslim terrorists blew the plane up in the air ...Does it relly matter how the Islamists killed the innocent people on the plane ???
she said it... she thought she was going insane.... see's a plane on fire.... in the middle of the ocean.... why would the plane be in distress? It could have easily landed long before it reached the location her insane encounter took place.
Did she also see a UFO and Elmer Fudd flying near the jet
Didn't hubby see it or was he passed out below from the all day drinking binge?
I'd question your mind also because you must be just plain stupid if you just now are believing your eyes. Its all a bunch of #$%$ and nobody knows what the hell they are doing and sure is a bunch of lying going on.
I saw Elvis while brunching at Burger King.
If OBUMA said this, his u.s.brainwashed Sheep would believe him...LOL
This lady's story is bogus. If she "checked out the plane's flight plan", she would have learned that the "planned" route was about 1,000 miles from where they were sailing. Why people do stuff like this just to get attention is pretty sad.
Talk about your typical Brit Twit,wow
I wish they would stop making those stupid so-called " videos". It's ugly , invented and brings nothing to the story.
Just does not pass the smell test. I think she was right the first time, she's insane.
Sounds like fighter jets shot it down.
Hey dumb BEOTCH.........if the plane was on fire and hit the water or the ground there would be a debris field, and the only reason this crazy broad didn't report it was because she probably just woke up from her drug induced coma............Only thing from this article........she got her name on yahoo news!!!!!!
BREAKING NEWS FROM CNN......The fate of the missing Malaysian flight has been confirmed. We repeat, has been confirmed. Again. We think. Probably. Okay, possibly. We are working to confirm. It may be nothing. Okay, its probably nothing. Oops, never mind. In other news, The White House confirms President Obama has walked on water. We repeat, walked on water.
I saw barry sotero eating a banana !
Is this another episode of Ancient Aliens??
Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue.
2 jets above the burning jets but no report from them - who came up with the video - really now
BAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!!!!! What does Marc Horn have to say about all this?
WHAT A GIANT LOAD OF #$%$. THANKS AGAIN YAHOO.................
Wouldn't that be in the same direction that some company claims they have evidence of wreckage on the seafloor, but their claims have been dismissed by "government experts"?
This is the same lady who looked away when they killed Benghazi....
I dont believe her. Just the way she puts things....like, I thought i was going insane....because you saw a plane on fire????
OK which governement paid her to say this? Was it ours?
Here come the loons. Come to think of it, I think I saw it from my back yard in New Jersey. I didn't think to tell anyone at the time.
Her 15 min of fame !
Crazy as a run over dog!
How much LSD did you take that night ?
#$%$.! This Idiot Moran of a stupid woman saying " I am sorry I didn't take action sooner" Take your head out of your #$%$ bottom you #$%$ head........! People died here and You dumb Fk. wait more than two months to say something...?!
She is a woman bro... give her a break..... she can only do what she can... you expect to much.
Geez, lady, do you think you should have said something sooner?
She musta been high as a kite!!! How do you see black smoke trailing behind the aircraft when it's the middle of the night?
Too much Tee will make you See anything !!!
This woman could see all this at night? The two other planes well above this plane? Wow! superhuman vision at best.
Kids, this is your brain on drugs.
And she comes forward now?? Don't believe a word she says.
She forgot to mention all the ganja she was smoking that night.
that the longest hangover i have ever heard.... burp.
I saw a dragon shooting rainbows flying over the crowd at a Phish show once, but that didn't make it onto Yahoo. :-(
I Do NOT believe that "sailor's tale".......It vanished because One OR BOTH pilots were whacked and did a Soft "Capt. Sullie" ditch in the water and let the aircraft sink down into 4miles of deep water. Another wacky islamic nutplan.
What was she smoking? BTW-the boat in the picture wont do much "Sailing".
What a bunch of #$%$! This is the government hiding their #$%$ up and trying to shut everyone up. Ya come forward 3 months later saying Yup it went down in flames. #$%$!!!!!
Tell me, why does it have to be the government (any government)? Why not just a woman who wants some publicity?
Yeah and I think I might have seen Elvis last year...
Boeing aircraft . She did see anything just making up a story while under the influence
So it took this long to cook up the story?
Why wait THIS long to come forward?
2 other planes, maybe the U.S.A. did it,or set up a false flag event to distract the world fomo our issues at the time.
Maybe she shot it out of the sky with her K 98 Mauser.
She had some good drugs that night,
Maybe she was drinking strong tea know what I mean as Leonard used to say.
She thought it was more likely that she was losing her mind? Who is she Gladys Kravitz? Prone to seeing things and Abner has to make her drink her elixir? You see something like that, even if you think you're hallucinating, you speak up. God bless those people on that flight and their families. Only you know...
I smoked some weed with bigfoot.
She thought it was more likely that she was going insane. I think she... is
This is more BS. The "authorities" already know where this plane is.
Gee, thanks for the TIMELY info, British lady! Probably one of those British Tories (England's version of USA's conservo COUK crowd.)
I call #$%$. Why has she not reported this till now?
She must have been smoking some GOOOD stuff !! hehehehe
Yes, and that was before getting to Thailand....
NSA CIA brought it down ????? USA must have blood on its hands I bet !!! Obama lies CIA FBI corrupt
Your cousins can't make it across the border?
Daily Caller..........did you make this up? If not, she sounds like she's full of it. Daily Caller is DESPERATE!
She was right the first time. She was hallucinating and she is insane........
I SAW A UFO 20 YEARS AGO... just thought I let you know... hahahahahaha... oh snap she saw a U.F.O.....
completely made up story. No normal person could ever believe this.
Proof that you shouldn't smoke crack and sail.
if it were shot down then the C.I.A. DID IT.....
Wadda Wing-Nut !!! This woman concluded the most likely scenario was that she "WAS INSANE", and made no Radio Report to the authorities immediately ??? Oh yeah, good call,
This story does not make sense so I suspect it is not true. If this sailor saw the plane she would know exactly where it was. Sailors do not blindly sail the oceans, they have charts and a planned path with GPS readings. If this was true we would KNOW today exactly where the plane is...move on to the next story....
Was she eatin her Cocoa Puffs at the time?
Didn't Courtney Love find it like two months ago?
Obviously, what this woman needs is just a 5 minutes attention or putting her name into a History book :-I). But, her story is such a #$%$ fabrication, really, she actually needs some Psychoanalyses.
If You do LSD while Sailing on The Ocean.....You Might See Santa Clause Too
The phrase "Cuckcoo for Cocoa Puffs" comes to mind.
Or some country or someone shot the plane down......Smoke can look black at night against a starry sky. Who knows, probably only God.
must be a slow news day. i seriously dought this woman saw anything other then some aliens coming to give her the anal probe.
Oh, to be rich and stupid.
Sounds more like 15 minutes, and a possible reality show!.
she probably thinks Palin is president...
I would not want to be with her if I were lost.She is to dumb for me!
what is she stupid?.. how long were you going to keep that secretbitch
I saw it too. And the Lusatania sinking. Man that was some crazy charcoal we used on our bbq.
the people in charge know where the plane is
She might want to keep her mouth shut before she comes up missing too.
Does she have lat and lon for her sighting?
Yes, it says she filed a report with the full GPS track data to authorities.
And I had dinner and good convo with Big Foot while camping! Thanks
A quote from the article: "She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time." That's just pretty freaking stupid? She did not believe her eyes??? Wow! OK. So how much does she think she can milk this for? I saw Elvis yesterday.
LOL "Night watch", yeah, wonder what else goes on at night up on that deck!
Sounds fishy, if you saw something, you SAY SOMETHING. Why NOW! Why not two weeks ago, or a month ago.
Why now? This gets my Oh My Lanta Award! Next we will hear that the plane is at The Gilligan Islands!
a commercial aircraft of that size can just vanish into thin air an they expect me to believe we have the technology to travel through space? lol
Fake!! Why come out now? You want your 15 mins of fame. Stupid #$%$
"she did not report the sighting until Sunday because she was having marital problems and thought she was losing her mind." "It did occur to me that it might be a meteorite. But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane." That was her conclusion? She might be right.
The people who put that video together have no concept of ocean voyaging,
Wow! It took her almost three months to come down from that LSD trip...
I'd go with this theory: "But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.”
hopefully this woman has been well compensated for lying to the world and giving the media more useless info to over broadcast
I saw it go down from my home in Georgia, where's the press ??
Yes, just like Sarah Palin could probably see it from her backyard in Alaska.
im over this plane BS. like honestly, its gone. no conspiricy, no, its gone
did she also see Amelia Earhart off the coast of Florida too?.....and home movies of Bigfoot in a forest
She got what she wanted on the NEWS
BULL*()&IT.. you would have come forward 2 DAMN MONTHS AGO if that was the case. Stupid fu()*ing indioits trying to get attention.. HOW pathetic.. you should be ashamed of yourself.
Pshhh..... I saw the flight before the crash too. Big foot was having tea with elvis on top of it.
Yeh.It was right next to that big flying saucer!
I don't believe her eyes either.
Why do she always be tripin?
“There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,”.... now, she is hallucinating .... lol ..
So, in otherwords she is claiming it was targeted and shot down?
So she waits this long to speak up?
.and her name is Amellia Earhart
Some people will do anything for attention!!! Pathetic!!!
maybe she saw a space junk falling down.
hopefully she wrote the navigational coordinates down and wrote it in her logs.
ok, shot down? seems kind strange all of a sudden some one knows something out of the blue, but who knows not imposable, but improbable.
Well, She doesn't know a sailboat from a motor boat to begin with. !
this plane will be found a long time from now, and im curious of what happened and why
Do you think this plane well ever be found?
And Amelia Earheart was flying it!
Where did she find those really killer shrooms that night?
The lady must have super powers to see black smoke in the black of night.
Reason why it's taken so long to come forward with her information is she could not get any bars from the space ship .
What took so long on this info?
where the sail at on boat...
Please give me some of those pills you were taking .
hhmmmm.... Did her husband see it too?
That is a friggen long time to wait. Would have been easier to mention it earlier.
im sure it was a chinese plane who murders those flight.
She's been out at sea wayyyy too long.
Sure she did and I saw an alien warship last night
What is this like the 1000th claim that will again lead to no where ... personally the plane has a better chance of being in a hangar at Area 51 then listening to some of this nonsense
I was a millionaire,but then I woke up. I also saw Bigfoot and man,was he blurry. Thanks for nothing,Katherine Tee.
she just woke up after more than a month smoking weed
BS ,, if she saw what she says she saw she would have been on the radio
Yes she just woke up and came up with this news breaking information !! She can't wait till CNN interviews her for this hot scoop. I suspect too much sun and rum and not enough water for her is the cause seeing black smoke at night........she chose to sweep it under the carpet for now ??? Maybe she should craw under it and go away...........................just a thought.
British woman ? Right their you know she's lying !
my guess is she was right the first time,,,she's insane.
hmmm, i think she just used up her 15 minutes of fame -- for ever in her life
yeah yeah... what ever, like some claimed that they saw UFO
Sailing is not what you do in a boat shown ! What you do in that boat is sky from
Well numb- nut @Cyndi first off the boat shown is not even a real boat , next ( and this is why your a numb nut ) you can only sail if your boat has a mast & sail ! WOW that was so hard to figure was it not ........... #$%$ !!!
You have to ask, Lori? Have you re-read (or tried to re-read) your first post? I have to side with cyndi on this one!
WHAT YOU DO IN THAT BOAT IS SKY FROM?
How's it your so stupid that but for the smart phone desided that I wanted to write ski but put in sky ,and besides all else that I wrote you are so stupid you can't figure it out. Another reason you & your supporter are NUMB-NUT'S !
@Cyndi how do you hear the written word ? Which is another NUMB-NUT mommet
you can't spell if your life depended on it. You are just a dumbo neanderthal. all you care about is calling stupid those who are superior to you. get a GED and get a job.
mommet.?? ski? desided? does not even figure. whatdahel ? English is my second language but I certainly can speak, write and publish better than you. oh, maybe try to make some friends by being NICE. how do you hear the written word? great excuse but it does not work.
And on and above it all your still a numb nut ! Say it all met with your troubling standers . That boat is a drawing & is "NOT" a sail boat ! Which is why their is no sail !
say it all met with your troubling standers. Oh I get it. English is your third language. Oh how brilliant.
My CHinese friends who grew up ion CHina writes better English than you.
Just grab anything out of your #$%$ and call the news they will report it no problem...Its story time at 5 6 10 and at 11...
i think she had pot edibles too!
Took too much LSD on that last trip ?
“There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,”.... This only deepens the mystery.
I saw a flyer saucer. NEXT!
Crackpot. That's not what she is, that's what she was using at the time. Rule of Thumb for Life: If you see something you don't see everyday, do something, like you know, record it, report it...SOMETHING.
Tee feels bad for not saying something sooner.------Really two months later, what dumb #$%$..
Lol, this claim is so made up why did she wait so long to say she seen the plane.
"I questioned my mind"...we have no doubt.
just looking for attention most likely drunk or drugged up at the time
Too many comments dishing her claim. Must be true. Plane was probably shoot down by U.S.
well, you got your 15 seconds of fame loser
Who would give this idiot press time????
i cant wait til the media war machine is in full motion ruining this womans life..
She's looking for her 15 minutes. Oops! Times up.
test her for drug addiction! does even she an idea what she is trying to do to the families of those people who were on board! i guess she gets a life sentence for this nonsense!
So now the media is going to print everything they hear from crackpots.. this one of course will fuel even more conspiracy theories
Meanwhile the husband carries a derp face and pulls his wife away from the media
Her story sounds beyond fishy ...
“There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,” Most interesting .....
That should be easy enough to verify through radar data. If data show three planes in that area at the time, then the woman's account would be somewhat corroborated. But, it's hard to believe the other planes' crews didn't report another plane on fire.
Evidently there are no "radar data" from that area.
hmmmm.........I smell something.....yep.So how is it again this women can see black smoke in the middle of the night....in the middle of the ocean?Oh and now you think its pertinent info (if it were even true).I'm gonna tell the "Daily Caller" about the little mushroom people that float on magic marshmallow clouds that were chasing the plane too
Everything about this story sounds like #$%$.
Turns out it was just her husband straddling her face for a facial.
Just like a Loch Ness documentary. 5 minutes in: This is our best chance yet to find Nessie!. Closing credits: Didn't find squat.
She fell asleep on her watch.
Interesting that the plane they're showing has propellers
So she and Elvis were out in a boat smoking some really good #$%$ and she saw....
It's June and she's just now coming forward? Something smells rotten in Denmark.
where has this #$%$ been for 3 months
Fox news will report it first, they are like the enquire.
Pish Posh that's Nessie on vacation in the Indian Ocean !!!!!
Crazy old bat looking for her fifteen minutes. Shameful. Absolutely shameful!
And I saw Elvis flying it.
The whole Malaysian airlines thing is a hoax. Just like Sandy hook and the boston bombings! FAKE!
Do your research before you act like i'm the one that needs help. If you believe any word the media/government tells you, i'm sorry to say that you're the one that needs to seek help my friend :)
Actually the "longer than an airplane, orange in color sounds like a typical UFO mothership sighting.
Wowwwwwww she waited this long, or better yet, she has that great of eye sight. Might as well check it out because the current search team has NO CLUE !
the flight took off in the middle of the night . . . how could she see smoke in the middle of the night in the middle of an ocean?
The picture looks like a P3 Orion.not a 777.
The 2 other planes looked like jet fighters with Chinese flag. Uhmm, the bully pushed the button a little too quickly.
Oooops. Where are CNN talking heads? Their rating is down - they need this.
Someone said that she was seeking 15 minutes of fame. I agree. My Comment is: Sounds FISHY to me!
I'm smelling some really BS mate! This story seems like a crock of #$%$. And yoa timing stinks too.
headline news seeker... telling a fib is my best guess.
If she thought she was going crazy...shouldn't she have at least sought out help for that? Either way...seems she should have told someone, either that she was going crazy (obviously only on this specific day) or that she saw something that has been plastered on the news 4 months now since she saw it. Either way....So what?
more lies. that plane landed somewhere.
Malaysian Air is the next Lochness Monster. More sightings will be reported ;)
Great. I hope she never needs help out there sailing. Someone could dismiss her distress as not important.
Great story... "I thought I saw it, maybe I did, maybe I didn't...... my bad" Thanks for the lead!
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.”... What rational person has these thoughts? OK..I just saw something I don't understand.. thinking.....processing......Oh.....never mind....I must be going insane.....pass the margaritas please.
Sounds like they picked up something to smoke in India and she got confused the last time hubby lit the match and held it over the pipe for her.... Probably going to Thailand for more.
This is just comical. Nice picture of a prop plane. Black smoke seen at night over the ocean? doubtful Here you go Yahoo run with this story................you seem to believe anything..... Ms. Tee is a paid patsy for the US and British intelligence agencies to redirect focus of what really happened to the flight.
I still see the plane flying!
It was probably just the fake plan that Charles Widmore planted there...
Is this a real picture??? She take this?
Then she saw Bigfoot, the Lochness monster and Elvis, all together.
I am guessing that this woman had consumed at least a few vodka tonics before "seeing" the hallucination......uh, I mean plane.............
It's a Bird, It's a Meteorite uh uh oh it was a Plane!!!! This chick come un plugged or what???? 3 Months later she says something!!!!
Oh she should remain silent? Look for the possibility critic that you are. Not so bright eh?
@Albert - She did remain silent for 3 whole months! I would have been on the yacht's radio right then. "Mayday mayday plane on fire and falling into the ocean!"
@Albert-Eh Chap that's the whole point SHE WAITED 3 MONTHS TO SAY SOMETHING!!!!!! You not plugged in dude? Read the article!
I believe her. It just sounds like the truth.
Ask the Rothchilds what happened to it
Finally! An intelligent statement! Agreed! And ask the CIA while you are asking the Rothchilds.
@Jim - I'm sure the Rothchilds have more important things to do , but since you don't, you came up with this no sense comment! Maybe you need to get a life bigot!
They do, they run our Federal Reserve, and most of our biggest banks, along with the World Bank. You don't know much i take it about this family do you? Them and the Rockerfellers control most of our money, and money system.
If she doesn't believe herself, ...
Is too late.i think may be she is afraid.but her husband is their.
Nice that she took three months to report her "sighting".
I think she's right, she is insane!
this is her 15 seconds of fame,,,,,i bet she knows the name of the second shooter of JFK is too
the boat in the pic is a toy fake boat....wow
Plane is in the tribal areas of Pakistan just waiting
...and you say liberals are idiots. LOL!
Hopefully you're in it's landing zone
But you said it already landed...? And you say liberals are idiots...lol
was Elvis at the controls mam ?
Newsflash: Next week she will hold press conference to state she witnessed the "other gunmen" by the "grassy knoll" and now believes it was the one who killed Kennedy.
This articles irks me..like really lady you "thought it was more likely that you were going insane"
Someone looking for her 15 minutes....
Yeah, and I saw Elvis at the Dunkin Donuts down the street.
Translation: "I was trippin BALLS at the time, so, yea, it was probably just a hallucination. But check it, I totes get a couple minutes of fame! Go me!"
now THAT is a real lead as to what REALLY happened!!!! Seriously doubt authorities will follow thru with it. Something very FISHY happened to that aircraft,....and I strongly suspect a cover up!!
Did see also see any signs of Jimmy Hoffa?
Hmmm, so was it shot down, by some rogue nation, and kept quiet??
should not have picked up that extra strength 'weed' from India
I thought these MH 370 storys , Where long gone . 4 months later , Still wild lying stories, Keep poping up .
Sure you saw it. I just saw Elvis at the local Walmart too.
geeez it took her this long to report it?????
Don't people realize that the plane was shot down, big cover-up people.
Robert is all knowing and all seeing you know. Bwwwaaaaaaaahahahaha
this missing flight is as "lost" as george w. bush's military records. we will never find either
I sailed those same waters one time and I saw Sasquatch on fire trying to surf. I couldn't believe my eyes. I wish I had tried to save him.
this woman is on drugs or being paid by others to lie she saw nothing as the plane is elsewhere all that have studied acts know that
clearly she was smoking da chronic
try to get mony, shame on you
I saw the plane as well. While I was riding the Loch Ness Monster pulling Amelia Earhart airplane back to the states.
Did she see General Tso too?
It's strange why the other two planes didn't notice.
the other 2 planes shot it down, dummy
You cannot find something that is not missing...
She was out there in those rough seas huh lol yeah right!!
Sorry i just refuse to believe the story.No one can be that stupid.
Good for you. waiting this long to report what you saw or might have seen. Really brilliant!!!!!
cia an fbi an th gov. did it an th world of politics knows why that's why they cant find it an th aircraft above ???? ASK obamaan th military th so called home land security myASSSSS just like they came an beat me on easter because iam wht catholic oooo sorry you hav cancer an we beat you an sorry we were at TH WRONG house ... loooking for areason to shoot me pc sht country an th #$%$ running it
You missed English class. Or maybe your class was texting. Soooooooo sad
sounds a bit dig batty to me, was she on an island all this time and missed the last two months of searching for it. a very fishy story.
she thought it more likely she was insane than a plane or anything else falling into the ocean...doesnt exactly make for a credible witness
I'll believe her claim of insanity.
Sure she did. What a moonbat.
no way the boat shown could have made that long of a trip.
And Elvis was in the pilots seat!! I know he was- he was -he was---I saw it!!
Yahoo's on a roll today! LOL
She missed her chance to call CNN!! They would bring their panel of "Experts" where they would hold discussions for at least four more weeks!! Nothing pertaining to News of course ....Just discussions and "What if's....perhaps contemplate a Belly Button or two....maybe three! How about the "Life Cosmos Struggle" from ultra violet to Infra red".
Two planes well above were two Chinese F16 ...
What a piece of bull poop!
You will find out, China accidently shot it down, covered it up, RIP to those lost
This alone will give CNN several days of "Breaking news".
She's a few fries short of a "Happy Meal"
OMG!...... she must really need ? Money for her next Sailing trip!@
And Bigfoot was behind the steering wheel.
good one james but planes don't have steering wheels, lol :-)
Evonne, Malaysian jets have steering wheels, but they are on the right hand side.
I DOUBT SHE SAW ANYTHING LIKE A PLANE !! THERE WOULD BE JUNK FLOATING !!!
Everyone wants their 15 minutes. :)
The thing is the defense lawyers use this weakness of the brain all the time. A lot of times when someone pulls a gun on you, your focus is so much on the gun that you cannot provide a full description of the person holding it. Most likely you can describe the gun better than the person holding it.
It is as a good a theory as any other.
Didn't report it because she thought she might have went insane? This shouldn't even be news.
is the video of her and her boat also ? haha
The only excuse I would allow for her not to report it is #1 She was Running Drugs #2 Smuggling People #3 She was High as all Get out. Any of the 3 I'm Good with any of the 3.
saw black smoke in a pitch black night? saw running lights from 10 miles away? its also almost impossible to tell if another plane is above or below from distance
“There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time,” She validate her own claim . . . she was hallucinating!
did she see Big Foot or Loch Ness Monster as well or was it UFO ??
I think she also said jimmy Hoffa and elvis were in the #$%$ pit
If that's true then someone shot that plane down.
who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
The Republican Party should hold congressional hearings to investigate how Obama is involved, plus Hillary!!!
Now she is coming forward???? People are getting dumber by the day
She waited three months before coming forward? And she came forward now because...?
and you just waited because???????? Trustworthy??? Wow
I saw Elvis and a sasquatch.
"But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Me too.
Man i miss the good ol' days of me sailing in the dead center of the Indian Ocean......
Women lack confidence. Any man would have either went to go see what it was if not sure, or reported it to authorities. Now imagine if a woman was our president......
You dont get laid much do you
She has a big boat with no cell phone?
Tooooo many holes in her story. I think she needs to hydrate and catch up on sleep. Nothing but a media grabber.
Everyone comments on this lady, as if they have some better clue than this lady .. This is the second time someone telling similar tale .. about a plane on fire..
If she is telling the truth, it would suggest the other planes were involved?
What's up with the picture of the speed boat when the woman said she and her husband were sailing?
They need to at least check this out.................a lead is a lead.
I would be more inclined to believe something Obama says than this story
Flight 370 was shot down by a Klingon Bird Of Prey.
Nothing like eating a few shrooms on your voyage to make it exciting.
Duhh is this #$%$ for real!! I guess rich people don't give a rats #$%$ to anything nowadays!!
I think this is simply a person looking for 15 minutes of fame....but if now, I hope her feedback provides some light at the end of the search tunnel.
Sure this wasn't Maureen Dowd after eating an edible?
it was either that or the tequila talking to me. not sure which.
what a fock tard, you saw it in march and now you talk about 3 months later.
Oh great. They're coming out of the woodwork now.
" But I thought it was more likely that I was going insane.” Trust your first instinct.
Yeah, and I saw bigfoot once... made a sound I would not want to hear twice in my lifetime.
She comes forward now???? Two other planes near??? Seeking the lime light lady or are you/were you just plain dumb???? Been on the water to long by yourself? Drinking and smoking?
Hey lady, you did not see Sh.T!
Just fake story so her can be seen on the news
She also saw Elvis a couple of years ago while on a trip in France...
Homeland Security will be talking to this woman !
She also said D.B. Cooper was flying the plane !
Must have been some good stuff they were smoking!
"She saw in early march"? look, she saw plane! #$%$,Jane see plane, me no know what to do.
The woman knowingly let a murder be committed and NEVER said a timely word about it....how can she live with herself?
Forget to take your meds that day?
Katie must be smokimg the same #$%$ as obama.
You skeptics, do you have better idea where to find the plane???? If you cannot help, shut UP.
#$%$ censors below me rump wrangler.
blowyoo censors are dumber than a steaming pile of dog feces
I think maybe the orange glow she saw was on the end of the doobie she was smoking.......
Must have been a blunt !
I agree with most comments here. Her stories has too many holes. She was in the Indian Ocean when she "saw" it, yet when she "looked up its flight plan, their journey intersected." How could that be? the plane's flight plan was from KL up to Vietnam then China.
Your an immature idiot you realize that...(g)
They more than likely blew up the aircraft in mid air and killed every body!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She could of seen a shooting star. I doubt she's lying. She's not even asking for money so I don't think she's a fraud. She saw something.
I saw several small green people running down main street. I returned the next day and they were gone. I should have told someone.
""Tee feels bad for not saying something sooner...."" I'm thinking she is full of sh!*
....and the people inside of the two other planes sharing the doomed flight's path? There is little doubt: George Bush and #$%$ Cheney.
That seems reasonable, Big. We sure don't know their whereabouts at the time of the incident. They're always so damn secretive...har!
Sounds like one to many high balls for this chick....
she saw black smoke in a pitch black sky at night - Hmmmmmmmm ????
Yahoo exclusive.....I'll bet they are so proud. BTW Yahoo....does the toilet paper Obama uses smell in Europe this week? Inquiring mindless want to know...
Touchy, your two left handed #$%$ cousins work at Yahoo....Gumfudge
I seem to recall there were - a lot of them - in the cargo section.
and...you never thought to take a quick snap shot????
I guess the 2 other aircraft would be UFOs?
CNN. They played this story 24/7 for weeks.
It's getting to be too easy to get 15 min of fame.
They should look where Romney's tax records are hidden
The plane is on the island called, "LOST"
Id say the ONLY SMOKE she seen was from her BONG !!!! WHY else would she say she was going INSANE?? A SANE person would KNOW what they seen!!! DRUNK or STONED perhaps?? Was their any GREEN men falling from it??? WOLF BLITZER will investigate probably GO there!
The people on the plane are all dead. That is the only certainty. Dead.
Maybe she fell and hit her head like Hilary did. Now she sees stars just like Hilary. What difference does it make? Maybe Susan Rice can come on all the talk shows and say something stupid like, "obama found the plane and told congress about it." or " I think she was looking at a movie about muslims". Then Kerry can take a long needed nap.
@john.........ha........ha........ha. You have the funny post of the day!
Sorry, but I got to say BS! You don't get your 15 minutes of "fame".
they will never "find" the plane because they do not want to "find" the plane, something is being covered up. obviously, because as we all know, with todays tech. it would have been found long before now.
Just someone looking for their 15 minutes of fame..... that plane is not in the ocean, it's sitting on the ground in a hangar waiting to strike............. anyone that believes differently has got their head up their #$%$. After all we can send people to the moon, but we can't find a Jumbo Jet? This stinks of cover up to me......
Right Commenter. Oh, and keep that tin foil hat on so the aliens can't get inside your head.
when I saw it, Elvis was flying it.......it was good to see him again!!!
Could this be a wacko,. why now ?
Sure. And I saw Elvis at McDonalds.
after the fact...thanks for nothing lady
You are a stupid lier .. And no one can solve your stupid dreams
Too much kool aid.... She now wants a movie deal !!!!!
smoke and mirrors or maybe she's "insane"
Anderson Cooper knows exactly where the plane is. He's not talking because the story keeps CNN ratings up.
This insane woman is right she was and still hallucinating, that it took her more than sixty days for her to come forward and be saying this non sense, she should had shut the f....up.
She may be insane but she got her 15 minutes of fame.
NO SHE DIDNT SEE THE PLANE, i did.
i think china shot it down and the USA knows and dont want to find it because it would really stir things up
Plane is in pakistan or iran.
this #$%$ is whacky....why is anyone even talking about her??????/hello???????????
Ten years later....still looking for flight MH370
Plane? What plane? Is Dancing with the Stars on tonight? The Bachelor????? How soon we move on….
WHO COMES UP WITH THESE STORIES ?????????? UUGGHH !!
she forgot to mention, this was just like the time she woke up on the side of the road with five dollars in her hand and a busted rubber hanging out her a~$~$...your two minutes of fame are over lady..enjoy!
I guess she is off her meds !
I had a dream a few moths ago.....
So did I. I dreamed they showed us license plates at the Kremlin in the 60s. Too bad those satellites couldn't see a plane in my night time vision.
I heard a story about 2 guys standing on a boat doc at an island in the indian ocean one guy was very tall the other very small and both wearing white suites and the little guy said "Deplane Deplane" just saying maybe he meant THE PLANE........holy jasper.....
I don't know what's your problem lady, but you have issues. For one, you should have brought this subject out a looooooooong time ago and not months later. And second, all she wanted was the center of attention since she and her husband were not talking at the time..... Maybe he was doing something else...............Hmmmmmmmmmmm. Just keep on sailing lady.
actualy , they just cover up of something that we dont know,who knows its just a big lie ,and u know why coz untill now they are still looking and searching its been how many months? right?,yet they never found of any small piece when its crash or even where it go think about this untill now no result at all ,what is really happen? its a big question mark?..
IT'S ALL OVER THE DAMN NEWS....She couldn't put two and two together??? I hate people.
And now she has gone missing................
I saw it too.....yeah I was ahh .....in Ohio yeah that's it Ohio ....in my back yard, yeah that's the ticket.
Took quite awhile to dream that story up didn't it ?????
I call bullsh#@t on this one.....
Toy Boat Toy Boat Toy Boat
I saw it too. It's at area 51.
absolute Bs story. all for attention.
Let me guess, Elvis was standing on the wing?
she also said as a sidebar.. Big Foot was flying it
Save our planet. China is large polluter of our global environment. Boycott products that are "MADE IN CHINA"
I thought I heard a ping the other day But It was just the aftereffect of eating Taco Bell
Why did she wait so long to report this? If she's telling the truth she should serve time for all the millions lost searching in the wrong place.
wel..she admitted that she is insane...
And the little green men, tell us about the little green men.......?
Little Johnny ask the teacher "do farts have lumps in them?" "why no the teacher answered" "well then I just soiled my pants Little Johnny replied."
i ran across "shoot flight 370 down" game app in the google play store. In the game you shoot down the plane and kill its passengers. Now its possible after me reading this article.
Hmmmm--sounds a little bizzare, maybe too bizzare?
I think it is safe to say this is obama-lama-ding-dongs fault.
Liar. What she saw was a weather balloon. Move along, nothing to see here.
she see what she see after one big glass of whiskey ???
Why did it take her so long to report it...?
straight up #$%$….why did yahoo even post this??
I guess this woman will be on CNN for the next two months as an expert.
she had probably eaten some of those same brownies ....that Maureen Dowd had recently ingested ....
she's got better eyes than the US Air force
she called the daily caller because the alien watch network guys wouldnt even believe her! it made her go 'insane' and she couldnt believe her eyes but....... she waited three months......... no wonder the alien network guys didnt believe her
She thought she was going insane? Two other planes above it? Oh...ok. Let's start searching again.
Maybe she also saw the Starship Enterprise..NCC-1701......LOL......Yet another loon on the horizon.....This time a Brit, and yes, I am British myself....but I can't excuse a loon, no matter what the nationality.
There was a UFO next to the plane and Jones' ship was rising to try and save the people crawling out. What a nut
Yep, even the Brits have loons saying they saw Malaysian Flight 370!!!!!!
I saw it from the San Francisco bay on my yacht also !!
#$%$, thumbs down !! LOL !!
This crazy woman is giving everyone thumbs down. LOL !!
Looks like CNN has more breaking news for tonight.
Why is she coming up with this now ?...after all this time
#$%$, haven't the families been through enough
She sounds like a nut case
I wonder if she got enough money from this interesting story to make another sail around wherever in the ocean? What was she doing in the Indian Ocean? Isn't that supposed to be one of the most difficult oceans to search for planes/survivors much less sail on? This plane is already down.....safely.....passengers history.....plane awaiting to become a missile...just a hunch.
I understand that Sarah Palin could see it from her porch.
Insane (and an idiot)...yeah, I'll buy that!
Was she having martinis on deck with Courtney Love???
How do you see a plane that never existed ??
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, ya feel me?
Whoa this is crazy, I was smoking a J and fishing on the beach back in early March and I think I seen a plane go down from the sky but I am not sure! It could be the missing plane! Who do I report this to? I want my name and some fame on Yahoo news too!!!
Well we have nothing else to go on, so let someone check this out and search the area. To think I spent weeks watching CNN for nothing, so this might be something. I heard the pings came from their own vessels- kind of like a dog chasing it's own tail.
I saw an illegal immigrant in the white house…..
she couldnt believe her eyes please people millions of dollars spent searching and she finds it while sailing yea right. .
Not too sure about this one, but it's worth looking into!
Uh...I hope this is valid. The lady seems a little off.
she didn't see anything,, she's trying to draw attention,, or otherwise she would of mentioned it earlier,,,,
Why were they "sailing" through the Indian ocean on a speedboat?
If that were the case, there would have been debris on the ocean surface. Seat cushions float, you know... As a side note, notice how this went away from mainstream news once other "scandals" came to light...? Deflection much?
I saw Jesus walking on water.
That confirms my theory. It was shot down.
Can her husband confirm her story?
did any of the pilots have fish for dinner?
I believe her. I saw tupac and biggie line dancing at a country bar last week wearing cowboy boots. But I didnt tell anyone right away because I didnt think they would believe me.
Really????? unbelievable this women did not say anything with all this time searching, yes she is correct insanity has stepped in, anyone in there right mind would have reported this after reading about a plane no one can find!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
someday someone will find it . maybe in 100 years . but someone will find it
Thank god this story came out...Now MSNBC will have something to report that has substance for the next week or so!!!
Can you say, full of you know what?..You are just now coming forward? What an opportunity to make some money, sell some books, and ultimately pay all your bills.
oh, lordy, CNN is going to go nuts again and will be all they'll be reporting on, biased, yellow half #$%$ journalist!
Wiat a minute, I understand seeing what she thought was flames at night but then to say black smoke was behind the plane? Its night time correct? How do you see black smoke? No story here!
ObamaMAMA and the DemocRATS have more things to worry about: BENGHAZI, the IRS, Fast and Furious, Solyndra and all the other Ӻᴗᴄᶄ ᶙᵽs. .
is it not a mirage she is seeing considering the place where she and husband were sailing then. its probably hot.
plane was shot down by usa.....if that were a usa plane the search would have been intensive....
CNN we have found Katherine Tee breaking news live at 6pm
Uh huh. And I saw Bigfoot, too.
Doesn't look like a sailboat to me.
I saw it too but wrote it off as bad drugs.
Holy cow! 3 months later? Is she senial or something? and she feels sorry for it? Might as well don't say anything at all! It's probably isn't even true and her story is not ligit.
If this is true, it only adds to the theory that it was shot down by fighter jets.
She is so full of #$%$. Oh... look at me!! I just saw Santa and his reindeer flying over my house. This lady is a brainless mouth breather
I see she has gained sympathy from those in her IQ level.
In my opinion she is absolutely one hundred percent lying........that's a ridiculous story and if you did see something like that how in the world could you keep it to yourself with all the families suffering and millions being spent looking for the plane.............makes me furious that she would tell a bull s story like that.
I heard someone saw the missing plane in the mirror while shaving.
she has been smoking with Courtney Love.
"She saw in early March, but is only now coming forward because she did not believe her eyes at the time." Now I guess she finally believes her eyes? Clue #1 she is making #$%$ up.
another wannabe tv star. what a crock.
Took you 11 weeks to realize it was real? Ya ok.
I keep bigfoot in my basement...I think, or I could just be really high right now and my cat looks much bigger than usual
Reminds me of the Lost series
Well heat and wine will do it
The plane has 20 high tech weapons experts onboard. If it was headed to, say, Iran it would make sense for it to be shot down.
If you're going to keep repeating that tired old conspiracy bullshlt, stick with the latest lie. It's 26, although most conspiracy websites simply call them 'high tech experts. And you're forgetting to say that the Rothschilds are behind the disappearance, or to mention the super secret underwater base and facilities at Diego Garcia. And don't ignore the reports that a B-777 in Malaysian Airlines livery was seen being escorted by South Carolina Air National Guard fighter jets to a secret Air Force base in the North Charleston/Myrtle Beach area (my favorite new conspiracy spin). I mean, just thin of all the new and improved conspiracies you're forgetting about! Be original, be daring, do a little more drugs and GO FOR IT!
Either way, we can now look forward to CNN covering this story for about 4 extra weeks now. Yay......
She must have been smoking weed.
So we are to believe that she feels bad now? I think not..Must be some money changing hands on this one somewhere.
Can we just agree it was aliens already
it was swamp gas or a weather ballon.
What a life !!!!!! Navigating the indian ocean towards Thailand doing acid and quaaludes , probably naked and full of lust !!! What a trip !!!
thought she was hallucinating and going insane...not a lot of self-confidence in that one
When they say plane, you better respond, "what plane"...
with her quicker the quick action I am surprise she still sailing!!!!!
She never asked her husband to look at the plane on fire, with the black smoke coming out the back...??
OH HERE IS YOUR 15 MIN OF FAME DUMMY!!!!
I didn't see any sails on the boat.......
Can we say bull%$@! I knew you could......
yah care to share any of that weed you were smoking????
ah yeah, right--I'll have what she was having--
I see a jumper on a bridge but I assume other people saw them so I am not saying nothing..hmmm
So I asked my boat Captain, Elvis Presley, if he thought it could have been a witch riding a broom stick, but.......
crack pot on the high seas.......!
I saw sasquatch once but failed to report my sighting..... he may have been on fire too.....gotta luv Yahoo "News" ;-)
Please tell me people aren't stupid enough to believe this kind of #$%$....
punch this liar in the mouth
2 things from ? I guess a) it still under water(somewhere) b) shot down/hi-jack
thought i saw a republican tell the truth once, i was wrong, thought i saw a republican that wasnt a bigoted religious zealot, i was wrong that time too
so she waits 3 months to say something ? i guess she dosnt read the paper's very much ,im not buying it
Boss ,, Da plane , Da plane !
shes lying, her lips are moving.
what were they hiding on their boat ?
That video reminds me of the cover up videos of TWA Flight 800 after it was shot down over and the videos of the 9/11 buildings falling straight down on their own footprint...
This is the exact reason people don't come foward...for it appears that the public will find a reason to discredit your statement!!!!!! People lost their lives and you would think that any clue, any evidence anything pointing us in the direction for solving this problem would be welcomed, but what do we do......we criticize, put people down, try to discredit them!!!!!!!!! LET THE OFFICIAL CHECK HER STORY OUT AND STOP ACTING LIKE WHAT APPEARS TO BE A BUNCH OF SOCIAL MEDIA YAKKERS!!!!!!!! This may help find people loved ones and it may not, BUT WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE!!!!!!!!
This woman is full of sh--.
I think I saw it in Newport Beach .
Saw ELVIS in Taco Bell last week!!
well,,, i saw Elvis just the other day,,,,,
The old crow has been in the sun to long....
More smoke and mirrors. Move along, nothing to see here.
perhaps she has the answer to why the flight disappeared....it literally exploded into orbit and is no circling the Earth as its own satellite that is why it never crash landed into the ocean or on the ground........what goes up...never comes down.....????
Sounds like a load of #$%$ to me.
Are we that starved for video feed that we have to make c*rap up? These Reuters videos are stupid.
What's with the model boat picture ? And missing a large finger in the back, pushing it along.......
i call BS on this !!
Too many thai sticks will do that to you!
Whatz she doing in the Ocean?? She would be a great fit in the Obama Administration.. lol..
HOAX just like the Moon Landing.
Effect of Indian " Ganja " !
I think I saw that thang too !!! I was just standing there........putting them cement bags up ther....when I saw this weird,thang !!! It was green,orange,chartreus and kinda cigar shaped.......
yah....and I think I just dug up Hoffa in my back yard.....
#$%$ shouldn't be drinkin' and sailin'........
The 777 was hijacked and at some time it will crash into some country with all kinds of bad stuff on it.
That's a load of s--t...she is not to be believed
they must do danm good drugs
It's Bush's fault and you're a racist.
WHAT.....YEAH RIGHT...! Sarah....Put the crack pipe down...!
I saw ET on 5th and Main tossing back a Malt 45....
The aircraft is in Pakistan. The passengers have been killed. The plane will show back up, Oh maybe around 911 duh. I'm not sure why they would pick that date. Nothing ever really ever happens on that date. Maybe a bad cartoon made them do it. WHAT DOES IT MATTER!!!!! Soon she will be Queen.
I call BS on her story..
Why the picture of the 'needle'.....
WHERES SHE GET HER #$%$,IT DID A DAMN GOOD JOB ON HER
I don't know that much about Boats but I don't think that is a sailboat....
she could be right.... maybe two fighter jet shoot down flight MH370 and ppl with power covering it up.... just saying. but she need help cause even if am high i would still call and report this could have mayb save a life.
Not sure I believe this....who wouldn't report something like that right away??....knowing that a plane has lots of people on it....
I think someone got into the sherry.......
So after all this time she comes up with this crazy story ha ha ha so I guess shes trying to say the other planes shot it out of the sky and that was a fireball that crashed into the sea sure ????????? what a crazy story so lady go snort some more coke or meth and fire up a fat joint and try this all over again
So if this is true it was shot down. I think it's in a hanger in Iran or somewhere. A plane full of cell phones and not one person sent a text or called. Right.
she didn't report it sooner because she didn't believe her eyes at the time?... i don't believe her now
I saw MH370 this morning!!!! You have to believe me!!!!
sounds like someone wanting their 10 minutes of fame....
Her boat looks fake, just like her story....
This is a smoke screen to take attention away from Pres Obama crime of all time!!
"You've just crossed over into the Twilight Zone".
My husband thinks it was struck down by "shark's with fricken lazer beams on their heads".
Next week, at a theater near you............."Flying Saucers From Mars Return Plane"....
Hang on..... I gotta turn down my #$%$ alarm....
Great..so you waited over 2 months to report this!!!!!!
In case you didnt know, it was already reported in the past that this flight carried LITHIUM BATTERIES in their cargo, and they had caught ON FIRE in the past on other flights. So this is likely what happened with this flight. Plane went down on fire, exactly what the woman saw ...
everyone knows by now that this is an inside job pulled off by the good old USA,,...Two escort planes shaped flight 370`s path and then downed it...Why ??? WE will never know,,, same as JFK death,...////
Please adjust the antenna on your tinfoil hat.
Wait! JFK is dead? Why was I not informed?
@treebark...as you can see by some of the comments, a certain percentage of the population will always think the government is perfect, wonderful, and could never do any wrong!
funny how no picture was taken ,,
Hey, I saw it too and I live in Northeast US ! I want my day of fame too !!!!!!
this woman is full of s..... she says that there were two more planes above of it, if these was true the other planes had report it
one question....was elvis on the plane?? Cuz we could kill two birds with one stone here......
Why does this woman's story sound like something to mock? Or is it you are socially stunted and just do not know how to react when confronted with something you clearly don't understand?
I bet she saw the Loch Ness monster too
Ya I saw Moses wipe his #$%$ in my bathroom about a month or so ago....
Mmmmm……. was this after happy hour or before ?
She looked pale in that video. Must have been scurvy.
yeah right, and you are coming forward now.. BULLCHIT!!!!
mel u r 100% right ( cant stop laughing my a s s off) that #$%$ is a100% nut case
bet she saw Santa Claus last Dec too....
this broad needs a rough Bt Fk
So it took her 3 months to "believe her eyes"?
and we believe her, check craigs list
“There were two other planes well above it — moving the other way — at the time” ????????? This story has to be made up or this person wasn't seeing flight MH370 ... other planes??????
B U L L L L #$%$ !
In her statement "Maybe I should have had a little more...", I was SURE that the next word was going to be vodka!!!!!!
that plane is gone ..sad but true...I don't think they will ever find it
wheres the floating recage ?? a plane don't burn up and leave nothing to be found.. not buying her story
No body believes me but I'm telling you the plane landed on that island that was on the TV show Lost.. That's why they cancelled the show, this has been planned for awhile..
That's nothing...Courtney Love also spotted it....while flying over
She and he were so drunk at that time.Trust me....
The women that spotted the plane on fire saw it one month before it left the airport.... lol
Believe it or not !... just sayin'
That plane was water landed and is at the bottom of the ocean.......
this sounds cool, yea I think many women like to hear...:)
It must have been a Klingon battle cruiser"
sarah palin saw it too...from her porch in Wasilla. It must have hovered over Russia?
I saw a fighter jet shoot that plane down too., but i am not sure what country fighter jet that is.
wonder if she can see Russia from front porch ......
Thumbs up if you believe her. I do.
I think Bukkake had her vision impared..
Maybe she crazy maybe she's not. Who knows!
If she lived in the US, she would have voted for Odumba.
thanx for coming forth NOW.... LOL
she wanted #$%$ she na mesee get #$%$ for a long time
How far away from her was this? Imagination? Why wouldn't you trust what you saw? Where was hubby? What is his recollection? Two planes above 'burning' aircraft? No report was made of this to any country? Does that mean then they were shot down? Now someone is hiding the details??? Good Grief.
I've believed that plane was shot down since the incident happened. Someone is covering something up.
It was a meth fueled mirage!!!
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Almost three months in the disappearance of the plane, the lady decides to speak about what she saw that night. Something is not right with her story. She saw two planes well above the missing plane and yet there is no info about those planes and what the pilots may have seen. That plane was hijacked and the responsible group is being tight lipped about it
I doubt she saw a plane and instead her first thought was correct, she is loosing her mind.
I believe she was enroute to the full moon/magic mushroom party on Koh Phagan island in the gulf of siam they have every month. You will see many strange things there, I know I did.
I go with glenn on this
"SAILING" IN MOTOR BOAT??????????????? AND HERE NO EVIL SEE NO EVIL SPEAK NO EVIL
.........or she was drinking and taking drugs???????
And she is just now saying something ????
I saw flight MH370 while I was touring Diego Garcia . . .
how did they get such a big boat??????????????????
ya and a million peeps see Bigfoot a yr....
OMG now this nut will be on CNN
No,no,you did just fine ,lady !the truth will prevail..i hope..
I saw the same thing, too. Except, it was difficult seeing the smoke, at night. We tried to fish people out of the freezing waters, alas they were already frozen. When we heard a faint sound of a whistle...
. . . and then Elvis disembarked . . .
Yeah, i saw Elvis the other day at the gym.
Was he eating a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich?
She is insane ..Funny how many rich and wealth are .Guess they can afford to be !
The difference in insane and eccentric is your bank balance
More disinformation to distract people. This is all to keep people from concentrating on an aircraft on the ground somewhere for reasons they do not want you to know.
for the good of mankind i hope she comes up missing.............
She was high at the time ..lol
I don't even believe she is a woman.
Susan Rice is going on the Sunday a.m. news shows to say that this lady is 100% correct.
I think she had to much to drink or to much drugs in her,you know these British woman
No debris field ... NO PLANE..... It's simply Physics !!!!!!
Time to make a name for myself..................I saw
Yea, yea, I saw that plane too but just couldn't believe my eyes. Yep, I was sitting in my john boat out in the pond when all of a sudden the motion detector lights lit up the back 40 acres. I thought NO WAY! Must be the tequila and proceeded to pass out from shear terror. I could a drownt if that earoplane landed on my john boat. That's my story and I'm stickin to it!!
Did this woman see flight 370 going in for a landing at Diego Garcia, if not she's lying
She saw 3 jets at the same time in that part of the world and that time of day?????
this is the most ridiculous story i've heard about the Malaysian aircraft! They were all interesting but this one stands out, black smoke at night, a plane with orange lights that resemble a meteor oh oh and 2 other planes above it ....hahahahahha...total BS!!!
The longer this goes on the more it looks like this is the work of Joran Vander Sloot
He would try to figure out how to impregnate the airplane.
Without a doubt the Aussies will be looking into her story trying to find out exactly where she was at the time of the sighting. I don't understand why some people find it so hard to believe that this woman saw something but then dismissed it or didn't think it was real, etc. Events affect people in different ways. Some would have jumped into action. This woman immediately started questioning herself. Better late than never though.
yeah , i we all saw santa and rudolf on christmas night
It's down there with the WMDs
