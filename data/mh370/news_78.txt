A Dutch cyclist who says he was scheduled to be on both Malaysia Airlines flights MH370 and MH17 — only to switch his tickets at the last minute — knows he's lucky to be alive but has decided to stop speaking publicly about it.
"I'm frankly overwhelmed by the number of requests," de Jonge said.
"What has happened is terrible, so many victims, that's a horrible thing.
From reverence for the victims and their families, I do not think it [is] appropriate to tell my story."
Officials say 298 people — 189 of them Dutch citizens — were killed when Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was struck by a surface-to-air missile along the Russia-Ukraine border.
While de Jonge said he is "happy" he decided not to take the flight at "the last moment," his story "is ultimately nothing compared to the misery so many people are [experiencing].
Attention should be paid to the victims and survivors.
Wishing everyone affected by this disaster a lot of strength."
"I have been lucky twice,” he said.
“You should try not to worry too much because then you won’t get anywhere."
